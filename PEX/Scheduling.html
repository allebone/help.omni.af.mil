<p>Introduction</p>
<p>PEX reads an Air Tasking Order (ATO) in the USMTF 2000/2004 and NATO formats, saves the general ATO</p>
<p>data, saves the mission data for your selected missions to help build your flying schedule, and permits you to update those missions based on an ATO change message.</p>
<p>Best Practice</p>
<p>Existing PEX sorties cannot be linked to imported ATO sorties. If you build a flying schedule in PEX, in anticipation of an ATO, when you subsequently import the ATO into PEX, you wil end up with two sets of sorties: your anticipated sorties and your imported ATO sorties. You do not want this. What you want is a single set of sorties with your ATO data. To do that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build your anticipated ATO flying schedule outside of PEX, in Excel for example. This anticipated schedule would include: # of Lines and Formations, MDS, Tail Number, SCLs, Crew, Show, and Brief Times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import the ATO into PEX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let PEX build the draft flying schedule based on the ATO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer the data from your anticipated schedule (Tail #, SCLs, Crew, Show, and Brief Times) into the ATO-imported sorties in PEX.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Import an ATO into PEX</p>
<p>In the ATO module, browse to the location of the ATO file. PEX reads the ATO and displays aircraft missions in the Mission Summary grid. Non-aircraft missions are not displayed, e.g., naval missile taskings (a MTGTLOC data set with no accompanying MSNACFT data set). The grid displays either all ATO missions or just the missions for the ATO units you have mapped to a PEX squadron, depending on your selection. By default, the ATO mission goes to the mapped squadron and is assigned to the default aircraft type (MDS) for that squadron, but these can be changed before importing. Select the missions you want to add to the PEX database. If required, update the squadrons and MDSs to which the missions wil be assigned in PEX and click Import/Update. After you import, PEX saves general ATO data and all the data tied to the missions you selected. Some of the imported mission data is not viewable in the PEX Mission Board but all data for a selected mission is available in the PEX database via web services. Data for missions not selected in the Mission Summary grid is not saved to the PEX database.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    A mission is identified as having a target (TGT) if it includes any of the following ATO data sets: GTGTLOC, MTGTLOC, or SHIPTGT. A mission is identified as having air refueling (AR) if it includes any of the following ATO data sets: ARINFO, 5REFUEL, or REFTSK.</p>
<p>Associate your PEX Squadron to an ATO Unit</p>
<p>As a time-saver, once you know how your PEX squadron is identified in the ATO, link it so you don’t have to select it in the Mission Summary grid for every mission you want imported. To do this, click the Display Only Mapped Squadrons hyperlink and a grid will appear listing all the PEX squadrons and a place to type in the ATO designation for each.</p>
<p>PEX Missions</p>
<p>ATO missions do not match one-for-one to PEX missions but they wil have the same mission number. An ATO mission may contain multiple MDSs. A PEX mission is created for each ATO mission MSNACFT data set. In other words, if the ATO mission contains a MSNACFT data set for F15E and another for B52H; PEX will create two missions, one for the F15E and another for the B52H.</p>
<p>PEX Sorties</p>
<p>PEX will create sorties based on the number of aircraft in the MSNACFT data set and/or the number of legs in AIRMOVE taskings. PEX will apply its formation logic to multi-aircraft (MSNACFT) missions.</p>
<p>Takeoff and Land Locations</p>
<p>PEX establishes these locations from the ATO AMSNDAT set DEPLOC and ARRLOC fields. If there are no values in those fields, then PEX uses the Mission Board user-defined default takeoff location.</p>
<p>!!! caution
    Your Database could have three instances of the same location, for example: PEX KDMA, ATO KDMA, and ACO KDMA. If you imported an ACO, then the locations have relatively complete definitions including Lat/Long coordinates. When the ATO import occurs, PEX will look to see if you have an ACO location that matches (e.g., ACO KDMA). If it finds it, then it uses that one on for the sortie. If it does not find it, it searches for an ATO location (e.g., ATO KDMA) and uses it. If it finds neither, it creates a new location of Source = ATO and uses that one. The issue for you is that PEX creates the ATO location KDMA, but it does not know its Lat/Long. Go to Setup &gt; Locations and enter Lat/Longs for frequently used ATO locations.</p>
<p>Takeoff and Land Times</p>
<p>ATOs do not normally specify takeoff or land times. PEX calculates an estimated takeoff and land time for each ATO sortie. For speed, PEX uses the Speed entered in the Aircraft Module for the sortie MDS. If no speed is entered, PEX uses 350 knots ground speed. To determine takeoff time, PEX uses the first controlled (frozen) sortie event time, for example, a 5REFUEL with an ARCT of 10:40 at location EXXON BLUE. If PEX finds the Lat/Long of EXXON BLUE (from the ACO import) and if PEX finds the Lat/Long of the takeoff location, then PEX calculates a reasonable time enroute. If that turns out to be 35 minutes, then PEX calculates an estimated takeoff time of 10:05. If any of the required Lat/Long information is missing, PEX defaults to one hour prior, or 09:40 in our example. To calculate an estimated land time, PEX uses the last control ed (frozen) sortie event time.</p>
<p>Controlled (Frozen) Times</p>
<p>PEX creates Sortie Events with frozen times for the following ATO data sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>AIRDROP (airdrop mission data)</li>
<li>AMSNLOC (location data for missions with no target)</li>
<li>ARINFO (refueling data for the receiver)</li>
<li>ASACSDAT (air control data) (no time)</li>
<li>ASUPTFOR (data on missions being supported) (no time)</li>
<li>CONTROLA (control data) (no time)</li>
<li>GTGTLOC (target location and description)</li>
<li>MTGTLOC (missile target data)</li>
<li>PTRCPLOT (reconnaissance mission location data) (no time)</li>
<li>RECCEDAT (reconnaissance data)</li>
<li>REFTSK (refueling data for the tanker)</li>
<li>SHIPTGT (naval target data)</li>
<li>1MSNRTE (data on an established flight route)</li>
<li>5REFUEL (receiver refueling data for the tanker)</li>
<li>7CONTROL (data on controlled assets)</li>
</ul>
<p>ATO Changes</p>
<p>Handle an ATO update just like an original ATO: browse to the change ATO file, select your missions, and click Import/Update. Missions with a gray background in the Squadron and Aircraft fields are already in PEX and wil be updated when you select Import/Update. Missions with a white background in the Squadron and Aircraft fields are new missions and will be added to PEX when you select Import/Update. The log file will provide a list of cancelled, added, and updated missions.</p>
<p>!!! danger
    Before importing an ATO change, ensure the original ATO has been imported. Check the Log Files to verify which ATOs and updates have been imported. If you inadvertently import an older version of the ATO than the one already in PEX, all subsequent ATO changes must be re-imported to ensure you have the latest data.</p>
<p>!!! caution
    PEX pre-selects all the missions in the Mission Summary grid for updating and adding. Unless you have a good reason for not updating or adding a mission, do not un-check the box next to the mission before clicking Import/Update.</p>
<p>Missions. If an ATO mission is cancelled, it will be cancelled in PEX. If the ATO update adds a mission, it will display in the Mission Summary grid so that it can be selected and added to the PEX database.</p>
<p>Sorties. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination matches one already in PEX, PEX updates the ATO data for the original mission. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination has more aircraft than the original, an additional sortie(s) is added to PEX. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination has fewer aircraft than the original, PEX cancels the extra sortie(s).</p>
<p>AIRMOVE. If the number of AIRMOVE taskings differs in the update from the current number of AIRMOVE taskings, PEX cancels all of that mission's sorties and adds new sorties in their place. If the number of AIRMOVE taskings is the same, PEX updates the data for the sorties.</p>
<p>Sortie Events. The data from the first updated ATO data set that matches an ATO data set in the original ATO is used to update only the ATO fields for that data set. For example, if the original ATO mission included a GTGTLOC, then the first GTGTLOC data set in the change ATO for that mission is used to update the original. Data entered manually through PEX for that GTGTLOC sortie event remains unaffected. If an additional ATO data set is in the change ATO, it is added to the mission. Using the previous example, if the original ATO had only one GTGTLOC and the change ATO includes two for the same mission, the additional GTGTLOC is added as another sortie event in PEX. If the change ATO does not contain a data set that was included in the original ATO, the sortie event is deleted from PEX for that mission.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting – Not All ATO Missions Show Up</p>
<p>When you browse to an ATO file, PEX parses out the units so you can pick which ones to import. If you know PEX did not list all the ATO units, there is a parsing problem, most likely caused by an ATO format error.</p>
<p>When PEX encounters an ATO format error, subsequent units do not show up in the PEX list. To troubleshoot a problematic ATO:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Save the original ATO and make five copies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first ATO copy, delete an entire TASKCNTRY section (including all its TASKUNITs). Save the modified ATO and use the PEX ATO module to browse to it again. PEX will parse out the units. If all the correct units show up, the ATO format problem is somewhere in the TASKCNTRY section you deleted. If all the correct units still do not show up, the problem is in another TASKCNTRY section. Keep removing TASKCNTRY sections until the ATO parses ok and you wil have identified the problematic TASKCNTRY section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second ATO copy, now that you’ve identified the problematic TASKCNTRY section, repeat the above removal procedures for TASKUNIT sections (within the problematic TASKNTRY) until you identify the problematic TASKUNIT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the third ATO copy, now that you've identified the problematic TASKUNIT, repeat the above removal procedures for each AMSNDAT group (including all sub-sets, such as MSNACFT, ARINFO, AMPN, GTGTLOC, etc.) until you identify the problematic mission (AMSNDAT group).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the fourth ATO copy, now that you've identified the problematic mission group, remove its subsets, one-by-one, until the ATO parses ok. Once you've identified the problematic sub-set (AMPN for example), compare its format to the USMTF approved format and you should find the problem, for example, one too many slashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the fifth ATO copy, fix the error manually and use the PEX ATO module to browse to it. It should parse correctly and list all units.</p>
</li>

<p>Bids and Availability- Basics</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Bids and Availability is a tool used to analyze personnel “wants” with scheduling “needs”. Unit schedulers open and close bidding periods by month, add or remove bids, accept or reject bids and re-prioritize bids. Unit personnel make their priorities known to schedulers through their My Page &gt; Bids &amp; Availability page. When a scheduler accepts or rejects bids the person's status is auto-updated. Use these pages in conjunction with the Mission Board, Flying Schedule, Long Range Schedule or Commitments Board on a two-monitor set-up.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    Please check all AF/MAJCOM/NGB guidance for implementation.</p>
<p>Permissions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Basic Users have full rights to their own “Bids &amp; Availability” information from My Page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground and Flight Schedulers create / modify and active bids and availability times / dates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules</p>
<p>Bids and Availability (B&amp;A) consists of three steps to function properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Setup of B&amp;A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schedulers use of B&amp;A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of B&amp;A from My Page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Controls</p>
<p>These procedures are accessed by navigating to Scheduling &gt; Bids and Availability.</p>
<p>Workspace</p>
<p>Bids and Availability- Setup</p>
<p>Personnel Availability Type</p>
<p>This defines the type of availability a person has (e.g., AT), within the B&amp;A module. Ensure that you are in the correct squadron and go to Setup&gt; Validation&gt; Scheduling&gt; Tools&gt; Personnel Availability Types.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right click in the Listings pane and select Add to select a Personnel Availability type from the he Master Grid pane. Select the Personnel Availability Type you would like to use for B&amp;A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add a new Personnel Availability Category, right click in the Listings Pane and select View/Edit Master List. Right click Add and enter the Availability Type and Description. The Type is limited to a maximum two letter code (e.g., AT). Description (e.g., Annual Training). Click above or below the new line entered to save in the Master Grid pane. Click apply or okay to save and exit. Continue to add types as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to add the Personnel Availability Types to other squadrons that you may be responsible for. Click on the Listing pane &gt;Send To. The squadrons wil be listed. Check all the squadrons that you need the information to be displayed. Click outside the Send To pane to save and close.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Personnel Commitment Type</p>
<p>Personnel Commitment types assist the scheduler in identifying the “type of Commitment an individual is being scheduled for (e.g., TDY, Leave). Ensure that you are in the correct squadron and go to Setup&gt; Validation&gt; Scheduling&gt; Tools&gt; Personnel Commitment Type.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right click in the Listings pane and select Add. Select the Personnel Commitments Types you would like to use. Click Apply or OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add a new Personnel Commitment type category, right click in the Listings Pane and select View/Edit Master List. Right click Add and enter the Enter the Personnel Commitment Type and choose the desired identifying color. Click off the line to save. Continue to add more types as needed. Once complete select OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to add the Personnel Commitment Types to other squadrons that you may be responsible for. Click on the Listing pane &gt;Send To. The squadrons will be listed. Check all the squadrons that you need the information to be displayed. Click outside the Send To pane to save and close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the type has been added, under the Conflicts with Shift column, check the boxes as applicable if you want this commitment to identify when a conflict occurs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Squadrons Availability</p>
<p>Squadron Availability will establish a squadron’s availability periods. Availability periods are broken down into manageable periods in which your unit operates. For example, 4 periods of 6 hours each (00:00-06:00, 06:00-12:00, etc) or 2 periods of 12 hours each (06:00-18:00, 18:00-06:00). To setup the Squadron Availability go to Setup &gt;Squadrons.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    Only PEX Administrators can add Availability Periods you your squadron.</p>
<p>!!! Note "For PEX Administrators:"
    Select the unit. This wil activate the Availability Periods pane located at the bottom of your display. Right click in the pane and select Add to open the Add Availability Periods pop up. Select the number of “Availability Periods” to set from the Number drop. Up to six periods can be selected. Set the Start and End times for each period. Click OK to save.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    A warning notice wil appear. Once you add the availability periods it cannot be edited or deleted.</p>
<p>Periods can only be changed by adding a new availability period record. If you are sure the information is correct. Select OK in the warning notice to active the periods. Once activated, the availability periods created will appear within the grid. The first number represents the number of “total” periods for your squadron.</p>
<p>Next to the period number are the actual time periods that were entered.</p>
<p>Personnel Availability</p>
<p>Personnel Availability will allow personnel to be available for squadron available periods. To set the Personnel Availability for an individual, go to Setup &gt;Personnel &gt;Personnel Tab. Scroll to the right until you find the header/column labeled: “Avail Enabled?”. It is located approximately half way across the Personnel Pane. Check the box for each person that will be using Bids and Availability. This action will activate a person’s ability to use the bids and availability functions to indicate the period that they are available. Click off the individual to save the information.</p>
<p>Bids and Availability for Schedulers</p>
<p>Two-monitor Setup</p>
<p>The scheduler can have a two-monitor setup. The intention of the two-monitor setup allows the scheduler to have the B&amp;A module displayed alongside another scheduling module such as Commitments Board, Flying schedule or Long Range schedule and others. Go to Scheduling&gt;Bids and Availability.</p>
<p>Place cursor in the top right center of the display and click on “Open in new window,” next to the Cog setup wheel. Double Click. This will activate a separate window for B&amp;A. This action allows you to move the B&amp;A module display to another monitor so you can view B&amp;A and another scheduling module simultaneously.</p>
<p>Scheduler Opens/Close Bids</p>
<p>The Scheduler uses the crew panel, calendar, details for people and bids for commitment areas to open and close bids. This location is customized. It wil also instruct you on how to open and close bids for your unit. A squadron scheduler wil open a bid for a commitment, to give personnel the opportunity to apply/be selected for a particular event (e.g., NCO leadership school or ADLS Training)</p>
<p>!!! Note
    In order for B&amp;A to work correctly there must be other scheduling modules in use. For example, there must be a Commitment created in Commitments Board in order for a Scheduler to open up a bid on a group commitment (i.e. a training group commitment for ALS training, or TDY to Hawaii).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Crew Panel. The scheduler uses the Crew Panel to display personnel and when an individual is selected, to activate data within the other grids (calendar, details for people and Bids for commitments). Select a filter (either use the funnel or use the drop down next to the funnel to select a filter). Names will populate in crew panel. Select a name, some or all. Use shift/control keys to select multiple names. Once a name(s) is/are selected, their “details for People” information will appear to see their availability, commitments, or currency (number 3 in the above graphic). If a commitment has been created within the commitments board it will appear in the Calendar grid (number 2 in the above graphic).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calendar. The Calendar Grid displays Commitments for the selected squadron. The information that is display is customizable by selecting the Settings (the gear wheel in the upper right portion of the screen; near refresh button) and select the data to be displayed. Click Okay to save and exit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To open a bid, place your cursor within the Calendar grid area and use the left/right arrows (below the Squadron name) to move the calendar right or left one month at a time to the selected “bidding” month you desire (i.e., Feb, and/or June). You can also use the small calendar icon next to the arrows and select the month. Once a bidding month is selected, place your cursor on the “red" rectangle labeled “Closed” next to the words Bid Period, and slide the Closed to “Open.” This will all ow individuals within the squadron to bid on any commitments during that month they are available for. They will see these “open bid” commitments within their My Data, Bids and Availability section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display Data By: As a scheduler use the “display data by” drop down menu (above the calendar/next to the squadron) to look at the following display options once you have opened up bidding in a particular month</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Availability: Shows Shortnames next to the commitment if this commitment fits their period of availability (if the individual entered their personnel availability within their MyData B&amp;A). This information can assist the scheduler in determining who might be present/available when he/she is trying to schedule personnel for a specific training slot/event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bids: Will display commitments. When you click on a particular commitment it will show names in green color if they have been scheduled for this commitment.</p>
<ol>
<li>If they bid on this commitment you will see a red circle with a minus sign next to their name in the crew panel. And if you click on their name in the crew panel, you will see their bid priority number within the “Details for People” grid.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitments: Displays the commitment data (Commitment Name, start/end time and remarks) only</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Close the bids. Place your cursor within the Calendar grid area and use the left/right arrows (below the Squadron name) to move the calendar right or left one month at a time to the selected “bidding” month you desire (i.e., Feb, and/or June). You can use the small calendar icon next to the arrows and select the month. Once a month is selected, place your cursor on the “green” rectangle labeled “open” next to the words Bid Period, and slide the open to “closed.” This wil close bidding for this month.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Accepting/Rejecting Bids</p>
<p>Display data by “Bids” from the drop-down menu. Place the cursor on a commitment to see who has placed a bid for that commitment. If an individual or individuals bid on a commitment you will see a red circle with a minus sign next to their name in the crew pane.

Within the Crew panel, select a name of an individual you want to add a bid for. Under Details for People their name will appear. If they have other bids they will appear. You should review these before adding a bid to ensure you will not “add” a bid for a commitment they can’t take. Hover cursor over the green + circle and the “add” bid option wil display. Click on the plus sign to add the bid. This action wil activate the Details for People grid (Bids dropdown must show), showing the person you selected, the priority of the bid, the commitment name, date, start/end time and type of commitment. It will also activate the Bids for Commitment grid. The individuals ShortName, and status wil now show that a bid was submitted.</p>

Place your cursor within the Calendar, ensure Bids is showing within the drop-down menu next to squadron name. Click on a commitment to see the proposed bids submitted by individuals (bids for Commitment area; right side of display). Within the Crew panel, select a name of an individual who has made a bid (this person wil be denoted by a red circle with a minus sign next to their name). Hover cursor over the red circle and the “remove” bid option will display. Hover cursor over the red circle and the “remove” bid option will display.</p>
<p>Re-prioritizes Bids</p>
<p>Local TTPs should be developed and used when a scheduler re-prioritizes a bid for other individuals within a squadron. Click on an individual’s Short Name within the Crew pane. Move cursor over to the Details for People grid (right side). Select “Bids” from drop down menu. The individual’s Short Name wil appear in blue at the top of the grid and any bids they made will be listed according to date, then time. The bid priority number for their specific bids, wil be in the white square next to the commitment information. Next click 84</p>
<p>on the bid you want to re-prioritize (if there are multiple bids). In the Bids for Commitment grid, all personnel who bid upon this commitment wil be listed. Within the bids for Commitment grid, use the scroll bar to scroll over to the Bid Priority column. Use the up down arrows to change/re-prioritize the individual’s bid priority. Next if you are ready to accept the individuals bid at the new bid priority, place your cursor below the status header, and select accept. Click on save changes button. Accepted bids and priority one bids wil go to the top of the Bids for Commitment list and in the Details for People grid, the bid priority square will turn from white to blue (accepted). Once the scheduler accepts/rejects bids the persons’ status is automatically updated in their My Data screen.</p>

<p>Commitments Board- Basics</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Commitments Board (CB) module allows you to build a schedule of non-flying activities. These activities are cal ed commitments because resources which need to be scheduled can be both people and equipment, therefore this module provides the flexibility to commit either one or both of these types of resources. It is a multi-faceted module all owing a unit scheduler to tie multiple commitments together into Events, create specific crew templates to match desired qualifications and crew positions, or to use the product functionality of the module to generate a mission planning sheet (MPS) or output a date range of commitments to an excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Permissions</p>
<p>Three permission roles can access Commitment Board, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator: Operations Desk, Flying Schedule or Ground Scheduling permissions allow for access to work within the Commitment Board module.</p>
<p>Basis User permissions are required to create a personal commitment form an individual’s MyPage.</p>
<p>Permission roles are assigned in Users &amp; Permissions.</p>
<p>Rules</p>
<p>Using the Events function, a scheduler can place an equipment commitment and a person commitment together within the CB module. However the equipment commitment portion wil not show up on the individuals MyPage. Only Personnel Commitments show on an individual’s MyPage.</p>

<p>Mission Planning Sheet</p>
<p>The Mission Planning Sheet (MPS) is designed for the Distributed Ground Control Station (DCGS) community. It resides in the Commitments Board and is designed to assist scheduling coordination. Commitment and personnel data automatically populate and additional remarks can be added. The MPS editor includes date/time stamped approval options. The MPS editor includes Letter of X warning flags when scheduled individuals are overdue, decertified, and/or expired for certifications.</p>
<p>Setup the Mission Planning Sheet (MPS)</p>
<p>Go to Setup&gt; Personnel&gt; Setup&gt; Office Symbol</p>
<p>Right-click Add. Right-click Add again (enter directly in the master list, not the unit’s list).</p>
<p>Enter “[Unit]/CC” for the office symbol, with [unit] being the name of the unit in the PEX database. For example, if the name of the unit in the PEX database is 80 FS, then the office symbol needs to be entered as “80 FS/CC”. In the Personnel Tab, assign that office symbol to the unit commander. Only one person in the unit should have this office symbol, otherwise, it may not return the correct person. Regardless, this field in the MPS can be overwritten and/or manually entered.</p>
<p>How to Use the Mission Planning Sheet</p>
<p>In the Commitments Board, build a commitment using a Crew Template. Add personnel to fill the template positions.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    When building a crew template, a role can be required or optional. These people are listed in the MPS Editor as “Personnel with Roles”. Those in required roles are indicated as critical, while those in an optional role are not.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    * You can schedule additional people on that same commitment who do not go against any of the template roles. On the MPS, they are listed under “Personnel Without Roles.” You have the option to check any of these people as Critical.</p>
<pre><code>* Select the commitment, right-click, and select “MPS …” to open the MPS Editor. Fill in the fields.

* Many of the fields all ow you to enter more text than that can possibly fit on the printed product. The extra text wil be truncated on the form.

* Save the MPS or Save &amp; Print the MPS.

* Only someone with one of the following permission roles can make save or approve actions in the MPS editor: Administrator, Ops Desk, Flight Scheduling, or Ground scheduling.

* After the initial save, when the commitment is approved, select DO Approve &amp; Save.

* DO Un-approve &amp; Save removes approval date time stamp, and saves any modifications and updates the last saved date/time stamp.

* DO Re-Approve &amp; Save, activated after an Un-approve action, adds Last Approved date/time stamp and saves any modifications and updates the last saved date/time stamp.

<p>AF Model Forecast</p>
<p>This tab is used to calculate the number of hours required to accomplish training and operational requirements. Using this tab is optional. If you already know how many hours you are going to ask for or how many hours you are going to get, you should skip this section.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the AF Model Forecast tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the bottom of the page, select New Account. Select the Period, BA, MDS, and PEC for the account you want to forecast. PEX will default an account name for you. If you prefer a different name enter it. Enter a version name, e.g., A, 1, or With CSAR. Click Save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Force Structure grid, enter the number of your Primary Authorized Aircraft (PAA) and Crew Ratio by quarter. If you enter the value for the first quarter and then click off the line, PEX will helpfully copy that value to the remaining quarters. You can change them individually if necessary. Using these values, PEX will calculate the number of API-1 crews your unit is authorized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Calculations grid, right-click on the Force Support line and select Edit. In the Edit Crew Requirements dialog, in the # Events field, enter the number of Force Support sorties you expect and in the Event Dur field, enter the average sortie duration of those Force Support sorties.</p>
<ol>

Select the API, Training Level, and Experience Level of one type of crewmember, e.g., 1, CMR, Experienced. For that type of crewmember, enter how many you have in # Crew, the Event that drives their requirement (e.g., RAP Sortie), the number of those events they are required in # Events, and the average duration of that event in Event Dur. Click OK. Repeat this step for every different type of crewmember that drives requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MAF Model. In the Calculations grid, right-click in the grid and select Add. In the Edit Crew Requirements dialog, select the Additional button. Enter one type of crewmember, e.g., AC Experienced. For that type of crewmember, enter how many you have in # Crew, the Event that drives their requirement (e.g., Initial Takeoff), the number of those events they are required in #Events, and the average duration of that event in Event Dur. Click OK. Repeat this step for every different type of crewmember/event combination that drives requirements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For additional crew requirements (e.g., CSAR Exp Sorties, In-Unit AC Upgrades), in the Calculations grid, right-click in the grid and select Add. In the Edit Crew Requirements dialog, select the Additional button. Enter one type of crewmember, e.g., CSAR Exp. For that type of crewmember, enter how many you have in # Crew, the Event that drives their requirement (e.g., CSAR Sortie), the number of those events they are required in # Events, and the average duration of that event in Event Dur. Click OK. Repeat this step for every different type of crewmember/event combination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Summary grid, PEX calculates the number of sorties and hours required for this account based on the values you entered. These hours would be your requested Allocated hours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Flying Hours, Quick Setup</p>
<p>These instructions will get your Flying Hour Plan (FHP) setup quickly to allow you time later on to become more familiar with other advanced features not addressed here. For many units, this quick setup may be enough, even long-term.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to PEX Scheduling &gt; Flying Hours module &gt; Flying Hours tab. In the Flying Hours Account grid, right-click and select Add. In the Flying Hours Account dialog, select the MDS(s) for the account, enter the Allocated Hours, Start Date (usually 1 October), End Date (usually 30 Sep), Version = 1, and give the Account a name (e.g., FY15 F-16 O&amp;M). Click Save.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    Enter the actual start date of the flying account, even if you are already in the midst of execution. PEX will allow you later on to tell it what’s already happened, using the Override Data command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice the new account shows up in the grid. Click on it to select it. Notice in the bottom Attrition/ASD grid that the Total Hours have been spread out evenly across the months. Click on any of the Hours cells and a Total Allocated Hours dialog comes up. Change the monthly hours to match your contracted hours with Maintenance for each month, ensuring they still add up to the Total. When done, click Save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dialog will read: “You should now go to the Weekly or Monthly view…” Ignore this dialog for the moment and click OK. Back in the Attrition/ASD grid, enter your expected Attrition and ASD for each month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just before the flight schedulers start building missions that wil be charged to this FHP, have them go to Mission Board &gt; Tools &gt; Pre-Mission Settings &gt; Add Sortie &gt; and set the default FHP to what you just created. This way, when they add missions, the default FHP will already be set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stress to the flight schedulers that every sortie in PEX should have an FHP selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stress to the Ops Desk that every sortie’s FHP should be double-checked after it flies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As crews come back from flying and they fill out their PEX AFTO 781, the sortie flying time will automatically feed this Flying Hours module. If you don’t yet use PEX AFTO 781s, then make sure the Actual Takeoff and Land Times are entered in the Mission Board or Flying Schedule modules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Flying Hours &gt; Overview tab &gt; Filter icon (top right) to select a particular FHP of interest. Use the Flying Hours &gt; Daily and Graphs pages to monitor FHP execution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Flying Hours, Advanced</p>
<p>First, follow the instructions from the Flying Hours, Quick Setup topic to identify and setup your flying hour accounts. Use these advanced instructions to specify no-fly and surge days. By doing so, PEX will calculate how many sorties and hours you should fly daily to properly execute your flying plan. You can then plan your daily flying in detail by identifying flying periods, times, sortie types, and/or number of sorties. Use the Weekly page for all your work as it displays extra data you will need; use the Monthly page for the bigger picture.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick the Plan. Go to Flying Hours &gt; Weekly page. Select the Flying Hours Settings icon (looks like a funnel) at top-right. Filter down to the single flying plan you are interested in. Starting from the left, select the desired Wing, Group, Squadron, Period, Budget Activity, MDS, PEC, a single Account and a Version is necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish the Override Date (if required). If you are already in the midst of a flying plan year, tel PEX what has already been flown on that account. On the Weekly page, right-click on any day and select Override Data. Select the month through which you wish to override data. Enter the flying data (Forecast, Planned, Scheduled, and Actual Sorties and Hours) through the end of that month in the plan. PEX uses these values as historical data. Overrides cannot be done by day, only by month. Click Save to save the override data. Click Cancel to exit the dialog without saving any changes. When the next dialog appears, redistribute the remaining monthly hours as desired. Each overridden day will display Data Overridden on the Weekly and Monthly views. You can delete an Override from the Flying Hours Override dialog by clicking on the Delete button. After overriding data, notice your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish the No-Fly Dates. Tell PEX the dates you don’t plan to fly so it wil take those dates out of the calculation. Right-click on any day and select No Fly Days. Select your no fly days and click Save. At the top of the grid are some choices which help you select multiple days easily. For instance, if you choose Sunday then all Sundays will be marked as no-fly. You could then click on any individual Sunday to set it back to a fly day. Or you could choose Federal Holidays and all Federal Holidays will be marked as no-fly. Notice that your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    When required, No-Fly Days can quickly be set back to Fly Days (and vice-versa) by right- clicking on the day (in the Weekly view) and selecting the Set as No Fly Day or Set as Fly Day. When you do, notice your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish your Surge or Minimum Fly (Locked) Dates. Tell PEX the dates you want to fly more or less than usual so it can use the information when calculating the required sorties/hours (Calc). Right-click on the desired date and select Change Sorties/Hours. Enter the number of sorties and hours you expect to schedule that day. After the values are entered, a lock will appear on that day. Later, when you re-calculate, PEX will use these manually entered values minus attrition for what you can expect to accomplish for that date. (This is how you tell PEX what you are going to schedule for a given day, instead of PEX recommending what you should schedule.) Notice that your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the Plan. On the Weekly page, when the Calc numbers are red, this indicates the numbers are not valid and they need to be re-calculated for the changes you have made. To re-calculate your sorties/hours, first decide on a date from which to reflow the Calculated Hours.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If your Flying Plan start date is in the future, you would choose the start date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your start date is already in the past, you would normal y choose a date in the future (possibly/probably the first of next month), thereby leaving the already agreed upon sorties/hours the same up until the date you select.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    On your selected date, right-click and select Calculate Plan. PEX will then calculate how many sorties/hours you should plan on a given day, taking into account your monthly contract hours, ASD, attrition, and Locked days. Notice that the Calc numbers are no longer red but are now black, indicating they are valid numbers with which to make scheduling decisions.</p>
<p>PEX uses the following logic to calculate the sorties/hours on a given date:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEX takes the monthly Contract hours and increases them to account for the attrition factor. E.g., 1000 monthly Contract hours and 15% attrition. The 1000 hours is increased to 1176.47, so when you lose 15% (176.47), you end up with the 1000 desired hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Current Month Only) PEX then subtracts the actual hours you have already flown this month from the remaining hours. E.g., 1176.47 minus 100 actual hours equals 1076.47 left to fly this month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEX then calculates that you want zero hours on No-Fly Days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEX then uses the number of hours entered through the Change Sorties/Hours dialog on Changed (Locked) Days and lessens the amount by the monthly expected attrition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEX then divides the remaining hours (e.g., 1076.47) by the monthly ASD to determine the number of sorties that should be flown that month. E.g., 1076.47 hours and ASD of 1.5 equals 717.6 sorties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEX then distributes the remaining sorties equally among the remaining flying days in the month. It then multiplies the sorties by the monthly ASD to determine how many hours should be flown each day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan Sorties/Hours in Detail. Now that PEX has calculated how many sorties/hours you should plan on any given day in your flying plan, you can specify in more detail how those sorties will be scheduled. Planning the sorties/hours to this level of detail is optional but many units find it helpful for coordination with Maintenance and outside organizations. To plan sorties/hours in detail, right-click on the desired date and select Plan Sorties. In the Planned Sorties dialog, right-click in the grid and select Add. Select a Flying Period from the list and enter a Start Time and End Time for that Flying Period. Select the Sortie Type and enter the Count. Modify the ASD, if required. Repeat, adding Flying Periods and Sorties until the Plan numbers equal (or approximate) the Calc numbers.</p>
<p>TTP: Once you have a date completely planned, you can copy it to other dates by right-clicking on the date and selecting Copy Day. Then, select the days and/or dates you want to copy to and select Paste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update Total Allocated Hours. To add or subtract Total Allocated Hours while executing the Flying Hour Plan, in the Overview page left-click in the bottom row labeled Hours. A new dialog opens and Total Allocated Hours may be overwritten. Clicking off the line re-calculates the monthly Contract hours in that dialog. Clicking Save prompts you to re-calculate the Plan in the Calendar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy Accounts. If you have multiple accounts to manage that are very similar in terms of no-fly days, ASDs, attrition, etc., instead of starting from scratch, you can copy an existing account and then make modifications to the new account. Once copied, the only things not modifiable are the account Start Date, End Date, Local/Zulu, and Location. To copy an account, select Flying Hours Tab, Overview page. Select the account, right-click and select Copy Account. Modify the Squadron, Period, BA, PEC, Name (mandatory), Version (mandatory), and MDS as desired. Click Save. Total hours can be modified by clicking on the Hours row in the Attrition/ASD gird after the account is copied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Version of an Account. Using versions allows you to develop what if.. scenarios. For example, you might need to calculate the number of sorties required with different monthly ASDs. To make another version of an account, right-click on an account and select Create New Version. In the dialog, enter a designation (e.g., B or C) for this version. PEX will copy everything about the original account into the new version. From there, you can modify attrition, ASDs, budgeted hours, and/or planned sorties/hours. Only one version of an account is active at any time. Inactivating all versions of an account inactivates the overall account. When you are done tracking an account, inactivate it so it doesn't show on lists anymore.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To Set a Version to Active. Go to Flying Hours tab &gt; Overview click on the account to be set to active under the accounts header. When the ‘Monthly’ view appears check the ‘Active Version’ checkbox in the upper left corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Set a Version to Inactive. Go to Flying Hours tab &gt; Overview click on the active account (shown in green) to be set to inactive under the accounts header. When the ‘Monthly’ view appears uncheck the ‘Active Version’ checkbox in the upper left corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete a Version. From the ‘Flying Hours’ tab right click and select the ‘Delete’ button. This wil not delete the overall account, only that version of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View an Inactivated Account. From the ‘Flying Hours’ tab click on the funnel icon at the upper right corner of the display and checkmark ‘Show Inactive Accounts’ and continue the selection process as normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete an Account. To completely delete an account all flying hour versions created for the account to be must be deleted.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    Once sorties have been created and logged against a particular flying hour account and version it is impossible to delete it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single and Multi-Day Remarks. If desired, Single-Day Remark and Multi-Day Remarks can be set by right-clicking and selecting the appropriate command. These functions wil not work on dates in the past. Multi-Day Remarks are displayed on the Weekly view but not the Monthly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background Colors. If desired, to highlight a particular day(s), right-click and select Background Color. This function wil not work on dates in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting Calendar Day. You can tell PEX what day of the week you want the weekly view to start on.</p>

<p>Flying Hours, Associate Units</p>
<p>If your flying organization is an association of Active Duty (AD), National Guard (ANG), and/or Reserve (AFRC) units, this topic details how to setup the PEX Flying Hours module. Let’s say the AD wing develops the overall flying plan for the base. They decide which days to fly and how many sorties to fly each day. After the sorties are flown, depending on whether the pilot and/or aircraft belonged to AD, ANG, or AFRC; the flying hours get charged to AD, ANG, or AFRC. If this is your situation, you need to setup an account for each MAJCOM (AD, ANG, and AFRC) plus an overall base (e.g., Langley AFB) account for them to feed into: 102</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for the overall base (AD + ANG + AFRC). In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AD + ANG + AFRC. In this base account, identify the overall Expected Attrition, ASD, and monthly contract hours (AD + ANG + AFRC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the AD sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AD only. In this AD account, identify the monthly breakout of AD hours. (These are the flying hours that will feed ACC’s Flying Hours Online (FHOL) application.) Adding more detail (Att% or ASD) to this account is optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the ANG sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for ANG only. Adding more detail (monthly breakout of hours, Att%, or ASD) to this account is optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the AFRC sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AFRC only. Adding more detail (monthly breakout of hours, Att%, or ASD) to this account is optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Overview page, right-click on the AD account and select “Edit.” In the “Also Update” list, select the overall base account created in Step 1. This will feed scheduled/actual sorties/hours from the AD account to the overall base account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat Step 7 using the ANG and AFRC accounts. Have those accounts “Also Update” the overall base account created in Step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the PEX Mission Board &gt; Tools &gt; Pre-Mission Settings, Set the default Flying Plan to the overall base account created in Step 1. This will default all new sorties to the base flying hours account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After sorties are flown, decide whether they are to be charged to AD, ANG, or AFRC and select the appropriate account in the Mission Board, Sorties grid, Flying Plan column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the overall base account to monitor the overall progress of the geographic location and the associated accounts to monitor AD, ANG, or AFRC individually.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Flying Hours, Monitor Execution</p>
<p>First, pick the Flying Hours Account(s) you are interested in. On the Flying Hours tab &gt; Overview page, click the Flying Hours Settings icon (funnel) at the top-right of the page. Make your selections and narrow down the list of Accounts to just the one(s) you are interested in.</p>

Right-click to export the data to Excel. The day is displayed in either Zulu or Local, depending on your selections when the flying hours account was created. To determine whether your day is displayed in Zulu or Local, return to the overview page, right-click on the account, select Edit and look at the bottom left corner of the Edit dialog.</p>
<p>Graphs Page</p>
<p>New Graphs page functionality includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opening the page in a new, separate window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colors matched to MAJCOM Flying Hour Program standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to export the graph as a PDF or image file, image option formats being PNG or SVG. While both PNG and SVG support transparency (the ability to view background through the image), SVG can be scaled to any size.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Five different graphs provide data about the flying plan Sorties, Hours (), Attrition, Average Sortie Duration, and Hours ().</p>
<p>Attrition. The Attrition graph displays sortie (not hours) attrition.</p>
<p>Hours (Line, not Bars). The Contract line on the Hours line graph resets to the Flown value at the end of each month. In other words, if you contracted for 350 hours for the month of October but flew 400, the October contract line would end at 350 but the November contract line would start at 400 hours. The Future Scheduled line on the Hours line graph takes attrition into account. In other words, the display assumes you will lose the specified percentage of the schedule. To attain your flying hour goal, you should schedule enough sorties so the Future Scheduled line ends at the same point as the Contract line.</p>
<p>View Summary Data</p>
<p>To view a monthly or weekly summary of the progress of your flying plan, go to either the Monthly or Weekly pages and click on the Summary link at the top right of the page. This will open the Summary dialog with data for the month of the date you had selected on the Monthly or Weekly page. The top half of the dialog breaks the month up by week. For each week, and for both Sorties and Hours, PEX displays the Contract, Plan, Sched, Actual and Delta hours for that week (or partial week.) The bottom half of the dialog has three date spans:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Plan through the end of last month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Plan for just this month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Plan through the end of this month.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each date span includes the same data as the top half of the page as well as showing Plan vs Actual for Att Rate, ASD, and Fly Days.</p>
<p>Day-to-Day Use</p>
<p>When you get so far ahead or behind on flying hours that you need to re-plan: create another version of the account. Do not create a new Account. In that new version, change your planning factors (Allocated Hours, ASD, attrition, no-fly days, surge days, etc.). Then select a date from which to reflow the hours, and recalculate the plan. If you then decide to implement the modified plan, select it as the "Active Version" on the Weekly view. By creating another version, you retain your original plan in case you need to reference it later.</p>

<p>Reconciliation, Identify Discrepancies</p>
<p>The Reconciliation page shows you your PEX and REMIS sorties so you can match these sorties and identify discrepancies between PEX and REMIS. To reconcile:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Scheduling &gt; Flying Hours &gt; REMIS &gt; Reconciliation page</li>
<li>Select the Squadron(s) to display PEX sorties</li>
<li>Select the month to reconcile</li>
<li>To see all PEX sorties flown on shared tail numbers for any squadron, check the Show Shared Tails box</li>
<li>Click the Go! button</li>
</ol>
<p>PEX will do its best to match PEX and REMIS sorties. A sortie is considered a match if the following data are the same: MDS, Tail Number, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Land Date/Time, Sorties Flown, Total Landings, and Total Full Stops.</p>
<p>If the above data are not the same, PEX will attempt to match sorties and identify discrepancies. PEX will identify a sortie as a Match with Discrepancies if the Tail # and Takeoff Date/Time are exactly the samFor the remaining sorties, PEX will match sorties in the same Tail # with the same Takeoff Date and order them by Takeoff TimPEX will highlight discrepancies in the following areas: MDS, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Landing Date/Time, Hours Flown, Sorties Flown, Total Landing and Total Full Stops.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to match unmatched sorties. View unmatched sorties by going to the Unmatched Sorties pagThen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a PEX sortie from the Unmatched PEX Sorties grid to display in Selected Sorties Grid</li>
<li>Select a REMIS Sortie from the Unmatched REMIS Entries grid to display in Selected Sorties Grid</li>
<li>When you have decided these sorties should be matched, right-click on the PEX/REMIS sortie pair and click the Match button</li>
<li>To clear a PEX or REMIS sortie from the upper grid, select another sortie</li>
<li>To clear both sorties from the upper grid, hit the Clear selections button</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the sorties are matched, they wil move to the Matches with Discrepancies taThere, you can edit PEX sortie data for sorties that have not been AFTO 781 SARM RevieweSorties that have been SARM reviewed are locked from editing and the SARM review must be unsigned before the PEX sortie data can be edited.</p>
<!--they apparently don't know how to spell check, not fixing it until someone can confirm through use this isn't what the program actually says daveDailey-->

<p>If you incorrectly match a pair, to un-match them:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the Sortie Matches Tab or the Sortie Matches with Discrepancies Tab, Highlight the PEX/REMIS sortie pair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Hit the Unmatch button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Reconciliation, Edit PEX Data</p>
<p>If you decide the information from REMIS is correct and the data in PEX needs to be updated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Matches with Discrepancies page</li>
<li>On the PEX sortie row, select the field to be edited by clicking on it. The following PEX fields are editable: MDS, Tail #, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Landing Date/Time, Sorties Flown, Total Landing and Total Ful Stops.</li>
<li>Click off the line to save the changes.</li>
<li>Once the fields of MDS, Tail Number, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Land Date/Time, Sorties Flown, Total Landings and Total Full Stops are exactly the same, the sortie pair will move to the Sortie Matches tab.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="flying-schedule">Flying Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#flying-schedule" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>FS - Setup</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Flying Schedule - Setup page allows you to establish requirements for Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, Post-Sortie Crew Rest, and Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule by squadron, MDS, and Crew Position.</p>
<p>Setup Pre-Sortie Crew Rest</p>
<p>Right-click in the grid and select Add. Select the MDS, the Crew Position (select the letter indicator in the column of the crew position code that your activity uses. For example, for an F-16 Pilot, select MDS of F-16C and P in the D2 Column. (The D columns are the five Sortie Duty Position characters.) Under Pre Crew Rest, enter the number of hours required for Pre-Sortie Crew Rest and whether you want the crew rest added automatically when the person is scheduled on the first sortie of the day.</p>
<p>Setup Post-Sortie Crew Rest</p>
<p>On the same line as Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, under Post Crew Rest, enter the number of hours required for Post-Sortie Crew Rest, if any. This crew rest will not add automatically.</p>
<p>Setup Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule</p>
<p>Click the Alternative Crew Rest checkbox. This is all you need to do. This is an alternative to only the Post-Sortie Crew Rest. It does not affect the Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, already established. The implementation is automatic when:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The sortie duration exceeds 16.0 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Mission Status - TDY checkbox is checked for the sortie</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule commitments have a duration of 1/3 of the sortie duration, not to exceed 96 hours. The generated commitment begins one minute after Scheduled Post Sortie End to prevent display of conflicts between the Post Sortie End and the Post Crew Rest Start. The commitment’s start and end times are adjusted when the schedule is changed, as wel as when Actual times are entered. Once generated, the commitment is not deleted if the duration drops below 16.1 flying hours. The scheduler must remove personnel from the sortie or use the crew details dialog to delete post crew rest commitments. Duration of Post-Mission Crew Rest is calculated in hours and rounded to the tenths, e.g., a 26-hour sortie generates an 8.7 hour commitment. To use this feature for off-station missions, ensure that schedulers enter the mission as a single sortie, where the sortie takeoff time is the takeoff time of the first off-station mission and the sortie land time is the land time of the last off-station mission.</p>
<p>FS - Sorties</p>
<p>Concept. This page is used to build sorties. It is not used to crew those sorties or to add loads/weapons to those sorties. If you are a flight scheduler, we recommend you do not use this Sorties page. Instead, use the WinPEX-only Mission Board to build your sorties. Then, come back to the Flying Schedule module to crew the sorties and to add loads/weapons. The Mission Board has much more sortie building functionality than this Sorties page. If for some reason, the Mission Board is not available to you, the following instructions explain how to use the less functional Sorties page.</p>
<p>Setup the Sorties page</p>
<p>First, hide all the columns that aren’t required: right-click in the header row just below the Date to invoke a context menu, select Grid Settings. At least one mission must be available to invoke the context menu. Click the buttons in the “eye” column that are required, un-check those not required. The Squadrons/Calendar selection grid on left may be hidden by clicking the left-pointing arrow next to “Squadrons”, affording a full Sorties Board view.</p>
<p>Second, configure column order: click-and-drag the column header and drop to desired placement. Third, and importantly, save these changes by right-click select Save Settings.</p>
<p>Click Settings&gt; User Preferences. Show cancelled sorties, when checked, the sortie grid displays cancelled missions. These sorties are designated with a strike-through.</p>
<p>Click Settings&gt; Squadron Preferences. These apply to all users in the squadron. Create mission as RPA mission, when checked, all missions for that squadron are created as RPA missions and are configurable on the RPA schedule. !!! Note RPA missions are not displayed on the Crew page and therefore cannot be crewed in Flying Schedule module. You must use the RPA Schedule module to add crew.</p>
<p>Difference between a Mission and a Sortie</p>
<p>A mission consists of one or more sorties. A mission always has at least one sortie. A mission could be a trip with multiple segments (sorties). A mission could also be a formation, where all the sorties belong together.</p>
<p>Add a single sortie</p>
<p>Click Add Mission and a new line will be generated to enter sortie data. Fill in as many fields as possible. Come back later and fill in the remaining fields as the data is known.</p>
<p>Add a formation</p>
<p>Click Add Formation to open a dialog where formation information can be added, previewed and edited prior to adding it to the schedule. The data entered will display for all sorties in that formation. Fill in as many fields as possible. Come back later and fill in the remaining fields as the data is known.</p>
<p>Add a sortie to an existing mission or formation</p>
<p>Click on the mission or formation. Click Add Mission&gt; Add Sortie to Msn/Formation. This adds a sortie to an existing mission or formation. If a mission, the new sortie’s takeoff time wil be one minute after the previous sortie’s land time. If a formation, the new sortie will assume the settings of the formation’s existing sorties.</p>
<p>Copy an existing mission to another day</p>
<p>Multiple missions may be duplicated to multiple days within a user-selected period of time. To replicate, select Replicate Mission. When the dialog opens, select a squadron and date. When the missions appear, select the source mission or missions. Select which data is to be replicated and the date (or dates) for your target missions. You can choose to replicate missions by days of the week within a date span, and by specific dates. Preview your missions with the Add to Preview button. In Preview, mission numbers and start date/time may be edited. Missions can be removed from preview if no longer desired. Click OK to create the mission(s) and close the dialog, Cancel to abort, or Apply to create the mission(s) and keep the dialog open.</p>
<p>Enter actual takeoff and land times</p>
<p>Double-clicking in the Actual Takeoff and Land Time fields fills them in with current time. To set a different time, select Actions&gt; Adjust Actuals. If you’re entering actual times from a previous day, you must select to show both the actual date and time columns. When you adjust actual, you have to set both the date and time. Enter the takeoff time first then the land time.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between deleting a mission and cancelling it?</p>
<p>Deleting missions removes them from PEX. Cancelling missions leaves them in PEX but removes all the associated personnel and location commitments. Before going firm on a schedule, delete the mission. After going firm, cancel the mission so it can be tracked historically.</p>
<p>Delete missions</p>
<p>Delete Mission allows you to delete missions individually or multiple missions simultaneously. To delete a single mission, highlight the mission, right-click and select Delete Mission. For multiple missions, a dialog appears allowing you to select missions within a specified date range. Missions created from the replicate process display "Source Mission" information. Missions that were created from scratch will not show any source mission information. Sorties can be deleted from a mission and, if no sorties remain, the mission will be deleted. Missions committed (firm) in the Mission Board cannot be deleted here.</p>
<p>Cancel missions</p>
<p>From Actions drop-down, Cancel Mission and Cancel Sortie allow you to cancel missions or sorties. To see canceled sorties, click Settings (gear icon), User Preferences, Show cancelled sorties; the cancelled sortie(s) will display with strike-through. To uncancel a sortie, highlight the sortie, right-click and select Uncancel Sortie. Committed (firm) Missions can be canceled but not deleted. If a committed mission with multiple sorties is cancelled, sorties may be uncanceled individually. An entire mission cannot be uncanceled.</p>
<p>Use all the different page controls</p>
<p>Squadrons</p>
<p>Selects which squadrons’ missions/sorties are displayed. Select any combination of squadrons by holding the Ctrl key while clicking.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    if two or more squadrons are selected for display, Add Mission and Delete Mission are disabled.</p>
<p>Calendar</p>
<p>Zulu: When selected, the sortie times are based on Zulu. Also, it allows editing dates and times in Zulu but not Local.</p>
<p>Local: When selected, the sortie times are based on Local. Also, it allows editing dates and times in Local but not Zulu.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    Local date is determined by the user's location set in the Users &amp; Permissions module. Start/End Date/Time: Defines the time span in which to display missions/sorties.</p>
<p>Load Sorties: Refreshes the sortie display after changing squadron or dates.</p>
<p>Page refresh: (counter-clockwise-open-arrows) Refreshes the page.</p>
<p>Pin page (thumbtack icon): Any of the four Flying Schedule pages (Sorties, Crew, Loads, or Setup) may be “pinned’ to open first. This is a user preference.</p>
<p>Date Display: Displays date or date span as selected in the Calendar control, in both normal and Julian formats. Arrow keys allow movement of the date or, if selected, a date span. If a date span is displayed, the span retains the selected number of days.</p>
<p>Legend: Displays a legend describing the color lines used to detail sorties.</p>
<p>FS - Crew</p>
<p>Concept. The main purpose of the Crew tab is to schedule people onto sorties. Use the Mission Board to build the sorties, then come here to crew the sorties. A secondary purpose is to schedule people for non-sortie duties, such as meetings and training.</p>
<p>Setup the Crew tab</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set either a Five-Day or One-Day View. To switch to a One-Day View, right-click on the desired day below any existing sorties (in blank area) to invoke Expand Day and click it. To toggle back to Five-Day, right-click and click Collapse Day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose which Sortie data to display by clicking the Page Settings icon at top-right (white box with green arrow). Go to Setup&gt; Five-Day View. The Five Day View Settings dialog will open. Select either 1 or 2 Row option, then drag/drop your desired Sortie data columns into Table Columns and order them by drag-and-drop. Click OK. The One-Day View is configured separately using the same procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose which Commitment Types to show below the Sorties. This is done from the same Five-Day or One-Day View Settings dialog launched from Page Settings. Simply check desired “Multiple Commitment Types Shown” and “Single Commitment Type Shown”. Most units select Leave/TDY for the Single Commitment Type in order to break out these long-term commitments from the daily meetings and training. Click OK.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    We recommend not selecting the Mission and Sortie commitment types because they already display above in the Sortie list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display a Crew list by selecting an existing personnel filter or creating a new one. Create a new filter by clicking the “funnel” icon, upper-left in the Crew grid. Clear the filter by clicking the red X.</p>
<p>!!! Caution
    When using the Flying Schedule Crew tab to schedule personnel onto sorties, you wil experience faster performance by filtering the Crew List to as few people as possible. With a Crew List of about 30 people you will experience satisfactory speed. With a Crew List of over 200 people it will take three to four times longer to crew a sortie. If you experience performance outside these parameters, please contact the PEX Help Desk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the Crew List to show or hide Availability, Squadron, Stan Eval, and/or RAP: From the Page Settings icon select Setup, then check/un-check from the menu (below Five-Day and One-Day options).</p>
<p>!!! Note
    Hiding the Stan Eval and RAP columns will increase the speed of this page.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pick the sorties to work on</p>
<p>You can see only one squadron’s sorties at a time. You can see people from multiple squadrons in the Crew List area but in the Sorties area, it’s one squadron at a time. Use the squadron selector above the Crew List to pick the squadron sorties you want to see. Next, select either Z or L, depending on whether you normal y schedule in Zulu or Local. Finally, select the date that you want your five-day view to start on.</p>
<p>Schedule crew members onto sorties</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the “Check Schedule Report” icon at the top of the Crew List (green checkmark). This report identifies scheduling priorities for the selected time frame. Move the report to another monitor or print it. The report includes data for all the personnel in the Crew List.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on a sortie to be crewed. Notice the crew list now displays information about each person. Referring to the legend, you can tell if the person is overdue for training, on DNIF, on a Restriction, on Supervised Status, already committed, in the zone for an evaluation, and/or their RAP count. Using the information from the Check Schedule report for priorities, schedule a person onto the sortie by drag-and-drop from the Crew List to the Sortie. When your sorties are all crewed, run the Check Schedule report again to see any missed priorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To remove someone from a sortie, click on the name and drag it back to the Crew List. You can also drag a person from one sortie to another. You cannot drag a person from a sortie to a commitment below or from a commitment to a sortie.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    When a person is selected in the Crew List, the name is highlighted everywhere it appears. This wil help you view a person’s weekly schedule at a glance. This is useful for spotting tight turn times between finishing night duty and starting morning duty.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    If a person is dragged onto a sortie that creates a conflict with another commitment, a Conflict Dialog will display. This dialog will enable you to “Schedule” the person anyway or to “Cancel,” which does not put the person on the sortie.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enter flight authorization and 781 data for the crew</p>
<p>Once the crew is scheduled, right-click on the sortie and select Crew Details. This Crew Details dialog allows you to order the crew by drag-and-drop. It is also the place to fill in the details of Duty Position, Crew Codes, etc. that populate the flight authorization and AFTO 781. The crew member at the top of the list is considered the Aircraft Commander and will be able to sign off the PEX AFTO 781 Pilot review. To designate the aircraft commander formally for the AF Form4327a, set the first Crew Code to “A”.</p>
<p>Hide Tail Numbers for No-Go personnel</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Mission Board&gt; Tools&gt; Options&gt; Squadron Preferences, check the Auto No-Go box. This automatically checks the manual No-Go box for anyone added to a sortie. When the manual No-Go box is checked for any person on the crew, the sortie’s tail number will not be visible to anyone on the crew on the Mission Board, Squadron Daily Schedule, or any Scheduling report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back on the Crew tab, once someone verifies a crewmember is good to go, go to the Crew Details dialog and manually uncheck the No-Go box. Once all crew members on the sortie are unchecked, the tail number will display.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    This manual checkbox is not tied at all to the automatic Go/No-Go page in PEX.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Add Crew Rest</p>
<p>In the Crew Details dialog, if the Crew Rest and Post Crew Rest columns are not visible, right-click and select Grid Settings. Check the box next to them and click OK. You can setup PEX to auto-add Pre-Sortie Crew Rest. This Crew Details dialog is where you can manually add Post-Sortie Crew Rest.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    To add Post-Sortie Crew Rest automatically using the 1-to-3 rule, refer to the instructions at PEX Help&gt; Scheduling&gt; Flying Schedule – Setup&gt; “setup Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule”.</p>
<p>Build and use Crew Templates</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Crew Template is a grouping of crew positions, e.g., two pilots, one navigator, two loadmasters (P, P, N, L, L). To create a Crew Template, right-click on a sortie which has been crewed with the desired crew makeup. Right-click and select Save As: Crew Template. Provide the template a Name, e.g., “Overwater Nav Crew.” Description is optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To apply a Template to a Sortie, select the Crew Set tab at lower-left, and drag/drop the Crew Template Name to the sortie. To view the crew positions on a Crew Template, click the “+” icon. To fil the template with actual people, use the Crew tab and drag/drop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Build and use Hard Crews (Crew Set)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Crew Set is a group of specific people (not crew positions). To create a Crew Set, right-click on a sortie which has been crewed and select Save As: Crew Set. Provide the crew set a Name, e.g., “R-21”. Description is optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To schedule a hard crew to a sortie, select the Crew Set tab at lower-left, and drag/drop the Crew Set Name to the sortie. To view people on a Crew Set, click the “+” icon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Schedule ground commitments from here</p>
<p>To add a new commitment. While holding down the Ctrl key, drag a person from the Crew List to the Commitment area at lower-right to the desired day. Release the mouse button while still holding the Ctrl key. A Commitment dialog for the person wil appear. Enter the commitment data, click off the row to save, and close the dialog. The commitment will appear on the Crew tab. If it does not, you have probably chosen to not see this type of commitment. To make it show up, go to Page Settings (upper-right icon) and check the desired “Multiple Commitment Types Shown”.</p>
<p>To add a person to an existing commitment. Drag-and-drop the person from the Crew List onto the commitment. You can build shell commitments, such as Alert, Duty Officer, or SOF on the Commitments Board, then use the Crew tab to fil the commitments.-</p>
<p>To remove a person from a commitment. Drag-and-drop the person’s name from the commitment back to the Crew List. When you drag the last person off a commitment, you wil be asked if you want the entire commitment deleted. You may want to leave the commitment in place to be filled by someone else later.</p>
<p>Schedule an evaluation. The person must have an open evaluation in Stan Eval Management and be scheduled on a sortie. Right-click on the sortie and, in the context menu, click Crew Details. On the evaluatee's details row, click on the field in the Evaluation column and view all open evaluations for that person. Select the desired evaluation and click OK. The scheduled evaluation now appears in Stan Eval Management &gt; Eval Details and the evaluatee's My Page under the Stan/Eval section.</p>
<p>FS - Loads</p>
<p>Concept. The purpose of the Loads page is to schedule loads (weapons, ammunition, chaff, flares, cargo, etc.) on the sortie. The sorties are created in the Mission Board, then come here to schedule the loads on those sorties. Loads can be assigned individually to a sortie or as part of a set (SCL – Standard Configuration Load).</p>
<p>Setup the Loads tab</p>
<p>There is no setup to be done on the Loads tab itself. Go to another module, the Weapons module, to identify your MDS stations, load items, and build your SCLs.</p>
<p>Assign an individual load item to a sortie</p>
<p>In the grid on the left, select the Loads tab (at the bottom of the grid.) Select a Category of load. Then, click on the sortie you wish to assign the load. At the bottom, the Stations Grid will populate with available stations for the MDS assigned the sortie. Finally, click the desired Load Item, and drag it to the desired station (not to the upper sorties area).</p>
<p>Assign an SCL to a sortie</p>
<p>In the grid on the left, select the SCLs tab (at the bottom of the grid.) (!!! Note ensure “Req SCL” is selected to display in the Sortie column header, configured from Crew page, Page Settings, Five-Day and/or One day View.) Click the desired SCL and drag it to the target Sortie (not to the bottom Stations area). The SCL name will display in the “Req SCL” column on the sortie grid. (!!! Note When building SCLs in the Weapons module, we recommend, in addition to listing every named station on the aircraft, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares; if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them.</p>
<p>Auto-build an SCL number from individual load items</p>
<p>Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which in PEX is called Load Code. For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading of 2500 rounds of code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. To use Load Codes in PEX, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use only a single station on the sortie. Call it whatever you like, “Sortie” would be fine.</li>
<li>Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them.</li>
<li>PEX will generate the Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board.</li>

<p>FS - ICBM Schedule</p>
<p>Concept. The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Schedule page is used to develop an alert schedule for up to two months. These alerts take place at various locations. Each alert mission comprises three phases: Alert, Travel (leaving from the location), and Off Days. The length of each phase is 24 hours but can be modified.</p>
<p>What logic does PEX use to build the alert schedule?</p>
<p>PEX will auto-schedule personnel onto alert missions using the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The alert schedule can be generated for 62 days max</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alert is manned with an MCCC (Mission Commander). Additional crew members can be MCCCs or DMCCCs (Deputy Mission Commanders)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you check the box Create Schedule with Incomplete Manning (recommended) and an MCCC is not available, PEX will build the schedule without an MCCC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t check the box Create Schedule with Incomplete Manning and an MCCC is not available, PEX wil not build the schedule</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person’s crew position is not MCCC or DMCCC, the person wil not be scheduled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person's Max Alerts per Month = 0, the person wil not be scheduled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person has another commitment on a day, the person wil not be scheduled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the alert location requires a specific certification, the crew must have that certification with a status of "Is Certified"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person cannot be scheduled for more than his/her established Max Alerts per Month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person's Max Alerts per Month is equal to 1 or 2, that person is not scheduled for an Alert sortie that falls on Saturday or Sunday. Travel and Off Days can fall on the weekend but not the Alert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with the same crew number sit alert together, when able</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a location specifies a Flight, crew from that flight sit alert together, when able</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available personnel are randomized, so the A’s don't always end up manning the 1st of the month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available personnel are weighted, so those who got fewer alerts "last period" have a greater probability of getting an alert this period</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Set this up</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintenance&gt; Aircraft: Ensure an MDS of LGM-30G is listed</li>

<p>Delete a mission</p>
<p>From the Flying Schedule&gt; Sortie tab, use the Delete Mission Option. Deleting the alert mission(s), deletes all three phases.</p>
<p>FS - DMO</p>
<p>Concept. The PEX Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) module allows geographically separated PEX units to share scheduling information for the purpose of maximizing training. Local PEX units register with their MAJCOM and this registration allows the local units to see the PEX flying/simulator schedules of other registered units.</p>
<p>After seeing their schedules, you can use PEX to send out support requests.</p>
<p>Register my squadron</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Setup &gt; Squadrons &gt; MAJCOM Registration tab</li>
<li>Click the Register Squadron button</li>
<li>In the Register Squadron with MAJCOM dialog, from Info Type drop-down select Scheduling</li>
<li>From the squadron drop-down select the squadron to register</li>
<li>Enter POC information as required. If your squadron already has POC information entered in the PEX Squadrons module, this information wil be pre-populated here. If the POC for DMO will be different from the one listed, overwrite the data. This will not override the POC information from the squadron page; it will be additional just for DMO.</li>
<li>Enter the MAJCOM Name. MAJCOM name wil be pre-populated with the value from the Squadrons module. You can overwrite the information as required. To register a squadron with more than one MAJCOM DMO system, just repeat the process using a different MAJCOM name and MAJCOM URL. The MAJCOM URL wil be sent to you; once you have it, copy/paste into the space provided.</li>
<li>Click Save. Clicking Save and New saves the information and clears the form to allow another entry. Clicking “Cancel” closes the dialog and no information is saved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once your squadron is registered, the squadron’s status at MAJCOM wil be “waiting for approval.” Your MAJCOM will then approve your registration. Syncing of scheduling data is automatic at pre-determined intervals or can be done manually via the Sync to MAJCOM button in the Flying Scheduling &gt; Sorties tab. There is no notification to you that your MAJCOM status has changed. Simply revisit the page or contact your MAJCOM by email or phone if you have any questions.</p>
<p>We’re registered. How do we see another unit’s schedule</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to scheduling &gt; Flying schedule &gt; MAJCOM schedule</li>
<li>One time, setup your view. Right-click &gt; Grid Settings and select to view DMO Support Requests. Select the eyeball for other columns you want to see and the padlock if you want that column locked to the left side of the grid.</li>
<li>Select the registered MAJCOM you wish to view</li>
<li>Set the date range you want to view. The filter selections display items that are scheduled. E.g., if you set a date range and don’t see MC-130P in the MDS list, it means none are scheduled for the selected dates.</li>
<li>You could load the schedule at this time, but you’ll get all missions/sorties for all registered squadrons. This may be too large a list to be of practical use. Pare it down by using the filter selection controls which will narrow your choices as you select each section. The list of squadrons will depend on the MDSs selected. The list of sortie types wil depend on the squadrons selected.</li>
<li>You can Load Sorties any time after you’ve set a date range. After you load the schedule, when you click on a sortie, the support request wil populate under the Msn Support Request at the bottom of page. The POC Information will also display. You can send a request email directly to the POC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Send a support request</p>
<ol>
<li>Click to highlight the desired sortie/formation &gt; DMO Support Request</li>
<li>The dialog will contain the Mission Number, Call Sign, and Msn Start/End times. Fill in information pertaining to your request using calendar/time controls and the 250-character window for Mission Scenario.</li>
<li>All other blocks are drop-down choices</li>
<li>Click Save or Save and Close. After saving the request, you are also able to Send Request Notifications. This tells the POC at the other unit to check PEX. It emails the details of your support request to one/some/al of the registered squadrons. When you select "Generate Email" the pre-populated email will appear. Proofread it and send.</li>
</ol>
<p>Temporarily suspend sending my scheduling data</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Setup &gt; Squadrons &gt; MAJCOM Registration tab</li>
<li>Click to highlight the squadron and MAJCOM you wish to deactivate</li>
<li>Click the Deactivate Connection button, and select OK at the confirmation dialog. The squadron’s record wil be highlighted grey in the display to indicate suspension.</li>
</ol>
<p>Turn it back on</p>
<p>Select your squadron and click the Renew Connection button. The grey background wil go away and the MAJCOM Approval status wil change to Waiting. Once the MAJCOM approves your connection, your scheduling information will be once again shared.</p>

<p>Long Range Schedule Setup</p>
<p>The Long Range Schedule (LRS) displays scheduling data in customized views. These data pul from their respective modules.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Commitment Types. Your full-range of Commitment Types (Duty, TDY, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shift Types. Your full-range of Shift Types (AM, PM, etc.)</p>

<p>Letter of X Certifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personnel &gt; Teams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two drop-down controls on the page. In the Personnel filter drop-down, select “(None)”. In the Squadron drop-down, select your squadron. You should see a list of people in your squadron and their commitments.</p>
<p>Views</p>
<p>Views allow you to look at different groups of people (e.g., Pilots, Loadmasters, A Flight, B Flight, Team Alpha, or Team Bravo) and for each group, a different set of mission requirements (Shifts, Certifications, and/or Commitments), and a different set of mission requirement warning flags for each. To setup a view:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide on a group of people to manage, for example “A Flight.” Use the Personnel Filter selector to pick your A Flight filter. Use drag-and-drop to order personnel.</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Totals Displayed button. In the dialog, click the arrowheads to expand all the entries.</p>
<ol>
<li>For Shifts, select the Letter of X certifications (e.g., Supervisor) you need to monitor for minimum manning. For example, if you need at least two Supervisors per Shift.</li>
<li>For Commitments, select the Commitment Types (e.g., Leave) you need to monitor for maximum allowable. For example, if you want no more than 5 people on leave per day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>Email PDF schedules to your personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage shift patterns, and to add or remove people from shifts. You cannot create Shifts or Shift Templates from the LRS module. Those must be managed in the Shift Schedule module.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructions below apply to a View (a grouping of people). If you manage multiple Views (groups of people), accomplish the steps below for each View.</p>
<p>Check for scheduling issues</p>
<p>In the calendar area, scroll down and look for any person/date blocks that have a blue triangle at top-right or a red triangle at bottom-right.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Blue triangle indicates multiple commitments are scheduled on that day and one needs to be identified as the primary commitment.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the person/date block to open the Commitments dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the person’s name to see that person’s commitments that day.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    The red X in the Conflict column simply means the Reviewed checkbox is not checked. It does not mean there is or is not a conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Display column, pick the main commitment for the day. This one shows on the calendar and is the one that counts in the totals below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Reviewed column, check the box and click OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice in the person/date block, the main commitment is displayed and the blue triangle is gone (indicating you’ve reviewed this block).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red Triangle indicates conflicting commitments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the person/date block to open the Commitments dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the person’s name to see that person’s commitments that day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the commitments to eliminate the conflict or accept the conflict.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Check for undermanned shifts</p>
<p>In the bottom section of the screen, under Shift Types, look for any blocks in red. This is where you have either a Shift undermanned and/or a specific certification on a Shift undermanned.</p>
<p>Check for excessive commitments</p>
<p>In the bottom section of the screen, under Teams, look for any blocks in red. This is where you have too many people on that Commitment Type that day.</p>
<p>Check personnel by Qualifications &amp; Certifications</p>
<p>This displays individuals' MDS/CP qualifications and LoX Certifications.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At top-left, directly below View, click the &gt; icon. This opens the Quals &amp; Certs grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag the gray vertical bar to the right to expand the grid area. You should see a blank panel with "Select operator(s) to view quals and certs."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Populate the Quals &amp; Certs grid. In the Operators list area, check the individual personnel checkboxes, or right-click and click Select All Operators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Quals &amp; Certs grid, right-click &gt; Grid Settings to select which columns to view.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Add a commitment</p>
<p>Normally, commitments are managed in the Commitments Board module due to its greater functionality.</p>
<p>However, to enter commitments directly from the LRS, the following is the best way:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the person/date block, right-click and select Add Commitment</li>
<li>Notice the date and person are already filled in. Enter the remaining data and click Save and Close.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit a Commitment</p>
<p>Click on a person’s commitment block to open the dialog showing all commitments for that person on that date. Highlight the Commitment and click Edit Commitment. Make the change and click Save.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    You cannot edit sorties or shifts from the LRS. Edit those in the Flying Schedule and Shift Schedule modules.</p>
<p>See all commitment details for a single day</p>
<p>Click on the date at the top of the column. A dialog displays the personnel. Right-click and select Expand All.</p>
<p>Email the schedule to people</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the Email icon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick the date range for the schedule you want to send</p>
</li>
<li>n addition to the schedule (Commitments), select which other sections to include</li>
<li>Pick the personnel you want the email to go out to</li>
<li>Click Edit Remarks and enter any comments you want to go out</li>
<li>Click View PDF to see what the report wil look like</li>
<li>In the Email area, type in your email address and click the Send Email button. Each person will get an individual email with only their report. The Cc person will get copies of all the individual emails, not a single email with a consolidated report.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I build recurring shift patterns using the LRS?  A recurring shift pattern is something like four days on, two days off, etc. You can build a shift pattern from the LRS module or the Shift Schedule module. To build one from the LRS, click the Shifts icon and Manage Shift Patterns command. For detailed instructions, see Managing Your Shifts.</p>
<h2 id="mission-board">Mission Board<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-board" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Setup</p>
<p>Concept. The Mission Board (MB) is used to build a flying schedule. Individual missions are created as either single sorties, formations, or trips. Airspace sortie events are added here. Once the missions are created in the MB, Crew and Loads are scheduled to those missions in the Flying Schedule module. You can tailor the MB to your flying mission.</p>
<p>How do I setup the MB?  following are the steps needed to configure the MB for your unique flight scheduling operation. However, you may not need to do them if someone in your office has created a MB template. To find out, go to MB&gt; Tools&gt; Template Manager and see if your office has a template listed. It would normally be named something like “757TS Flight Scheduling”. If so, go ahead and Open it, close the MB, and come back to the MB. If you applied a template, you should skip the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick your View, Fighter or Standard. There are two available views. The Standard View (S icon below the menu bar) is for missions requiring a large amount of detailed information regarding sorties, events, and timing. This “S” view is normally used by Airlift, Bombers, Tankers, and other large aircraft. The Fighter View (F icon below the menu bar) is normally used by Fighters and Trainer aircraft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick your columns. Go to View&gt; Hide/Unhide Columns and select the columns to display (you need to have a least one selection in each list).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Order and size your columns. Drag-and-drop the columns to the order you want by double left clicking on them, holding the column header, and dragging it to the proper location. Size the column by left clicking and holding on the right edge of the column and drag it either right or left to size it appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your Add Sortie preferences. Go to Tools&gt; Pre-Mission Settings&gt; Add Sortie tab. Select the MDS and Flying Plan to default when you add a sortie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your Add Sortie Event preferences. Go to Tools&gt; Pre-Mission Settings&gt; Add Sortie Events tab. Select the default takeoff and land locations, crew show time, crew brief time, and crew post-sortie end time. Post-sortie end time is how much time you want to all ow the crew after they land to complete paperwork before you schedule them for something else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Takeoff Time preference. Go to Tools&gt; Pre-Mission Settings&gt; Change Takeoff Time tab. Tell PEX what to do when you change the takeoff time. We recommend you select Changes Show and Brief Dates/Times by Offset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set MB User Options. Go to Tools&gt; Options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the Location Source to PEX</li>
<li>If your part-time personnel use the PEX Availability inputs, enable the Availability selection</li>
<li>Select Sorties by Takeoff Date to exclude sorties that took off yesterday but land today</li>
<li>Choose whether to see Cancelled Missions/Sorties</li>
<li>If you schedule traditional formations (all sorties on one flight plan), check the box for Auto Replicate Formation Data</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set MB Squadron Options</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Airspace</p>
<ol>
<li>Fighters and Trainers. If your sorties typically go to one airspace per sortie, pick “Airspace” once. Leave the others blank. If your sorties go to two airspaces per sortie, like a MOA and an AR Track, pick Airspace twice. And so on, up to five.</li>
<li>Airlift, Bombers, Tankers, etc. Leave Blank. Use Sortie Event Sets instead.</li>
<li>Adjust your columns in the Sorties grid to account for these new columns.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actual Takeoff and Land Time Deviations. The MB will highlight actual takeoff and land times outside the minutes you set here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PFPS. Leave blank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supervisor Types. You can schedule up to three types of supervisors from the MB. Pick the three types here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RPA Unit. Select the box for “Create MSN as RPA MSN”. This sets different logic on the missions add and allows the use of the RPA Scheduler module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto No-Go. The MB includes a manual No-Go process, not linked to the Go/No-Go module in PEX. Enable Auto No-Go to mark all your people as No-Go on the MB until you manually check them as Go. This feature is used in our tail number denial process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto Sortie Numbering. The “Enable Auto Sortie #/Line #” adds a sortie number and line number to each sortie. Enter the starting Line Number. When you add sorties, PEX wil number them for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Notifications. The “Set Change Notifications” button allows you to select which fields trigger change notification actions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save your setup as a template for others. To save others in your office the time of setting up their MBs from scratch and to have a standardized view across the office, save your MB as a template. To do so, go to Tools&gt; Template Manager and select Save As. Give the template a name such as “757TS Flight Scheduling.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Build Sorties</p>
<p>What’s the difference between a Mission and a Sortie?  In PEX, sorties belong to a mission. A mission could have just one sortie, plain and simple, think bombers and tankers. Alternatively, a mission could include multiple sorties, a trip, an aircraft and crew that fly multiple sorties, think airlift. A mission could also be comprised or formation sorties, think fighters and trainers.</p>
<p>How do I build a single-sortie mission?  Click the "+ M" icon on the menu bar. A new line will be generated in the Mission and Sorties grids. In the Mission grid, enter a Mission Number. In the Sorties grid, enter your sortie data. The Sortie times will drive the Mission Times.</p>
<p>How do I build a trip mission?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to Tools&gt; Options and turn off Sorties by Takeoff Date. If you don’t do this, when you add a sortie on a different day, the sortie will “disappear” to its assigned takeoff date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build a mission with multiple legs, start by adding a mission with a single sortie as described above. Once the mission is added and the data is added for the first sortie, right-click on that sortie and select Add Sortie to Mission. Once this is done a sortie wil be added with the takeoff time being one minute after the land time of the previous sortie. Also, the takeoff location be set to the land location of the previous sortie. Edit the second sortie data as necessary. To add another sortie, just repeat the process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I build a formation mission?  Click the "+ F" icon on the menu bar. Once you get the Add Formation dialog, enter your data. A field marked with an asterisk “*” is mandatory. The dialog is divided into three areas: Basic Sortie Data, Airspace, and View. The first two areas are self-explanatory. The View grid is useful for adding additional formation data. The crew members and call signs can be entered on “Summary/Crewmembers” page. By clicking on the “Other Formation Data” you can enter other data pertaining to the formation. Once you complete the dialog data entry, click OK to add the formation to the MB.</p>
<p>How can I break up a 4-ship into two 2-ships (or vice versa)?  Right-click on a sortie and select Move Selected Sortie to Formation. “New” wil create a new formation. The sortie wil keep the line # and the tail number when moved.</p>
<p>How do I copy a sortie, a formation, an entire day, or an entire week?  You can replicate a mission or multiple missions to different days using the Replicate Mission(s) function. To replicate a mission, right-click in the Missions grid and select Replicate Mission(s). A dialog will appear that will allow you to select a date range to choose which missions you want to replicate (use the CTRL key to multi-select). Then choose what data you want to replicate. Finally, you can select a date range and add the missions by the day of the week or just a day. Once the missions and dates are selected, click Apply or OK. If you click Apply, the dialog will remain open for more replication.</p>
<p>How do I delete a single sortie?  Right-click delete. The last sortie in a mission wil not delete. You need to delete the mission in this case.</p>
<p>How do I delete a mission?  Show the Mission grid if it’s hidden (the M icon with a red slash). To delete a single mission, highlight the mission, right-click and select Delete Mission. To delete multiple missions, right-click in the Missions grid and select Delete Missions. . A dialog will appear that allows you to select missions within a specified date range. Missions that were created from the replication process display Source Mission information. Missions that were created from scratch will not show any source mission information.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    once a mission has been committed, it cannot be deleted, only canceled.</p>
<p>Mission Events</p>
<p>What are Mission Events?  Mission Events are action items associated to the mission. Example mission events are: Coordinate PPR, Submit ICAO Flight Plan, Mobility Processing, briefings, etc. Mission Events are a good place to track these things.</p>
<p>How do I add a Mission Event?  Place the cursor in the Mission Events grid, right-click and select Add Mission Event. A line will be generated to enter the event.</p>
<p>How do I delete a Mission Event?  Right-click on it and select Delete Mission Event.</p>
<p>How do I add a group of Mission Events?  Mission Event Sets are useful when the same mission events are used repeatedly with maybe only the dates changing. Using a Mission Event Set you don’t have to build the profile from scratch each time, only the first time. Subsequently, you can simply add a Mission Event Set to a mission and identify a new base date. all the other dates wil adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>How do I create a Mission Event Set?  Enter the individual events in the Mission Events grid with dates and then right-click and select Save Mission Event Set. A dialog box will appear asking for a name and description for the set. When completed, the set will be saved and the set name will appear in the Available Mission Event Sets grid on the Mission Events Builder tab.</p>
<p>How do I add a Mission Event Set to a mission?  Highlight the desired mission and select the Mission Events Builder tab. Highlight the set in the Available Mission Event Sets grid and click the Add Set to Mission button. A dialog will appear requesting a date to offset. All the events will offset from that date. A dialog will appear asking what to do about existing Mission Events, always select Yes.</p>
<p>How do I clear all Mission Events?  Click Clear Mission Events. This deletes all mission events except Show and Post Mission End.</p>
<p>How can I freeze a Mission Event date/time?  Click Freeze/Unfreeze Date/Time. Freezing a date/time prevents cascade options from taking effect. Frozen date/times are displayed with a blue background.</p>
<p>Sortie Events</p>
<p>What are Sortie Events?  Sortie Events are defined as a group of events that will be accomplished just before, during, and after the sortie. When you add a sortie in PEX, it comes with five standard sortie events: Show, Brief T/O, Land, and Post Sortie End. You can add others such as: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, Area Entry, and Area Exit. Sortie events can be added in the Standard view on the Mission Builder or by clicking on the Sortie Events tab. The Sortie Events grid or tab displays sortie events assigned to the highlighted sortie. Sortie events can be assigned individually or as a set to a selected sortie.</p>
<p>How do I add individual sortie events?  Right-click in the Sortie Events grid and select Add Sortie Event. A new line wil be generated to enter the event.</p>
<p>How do I delete an individual sortie event?  Right-click on it and select Delete Sortie Event.</p>
<p>What are Sortie Event Sets?  Sortie Event Sets are useful when the same sortie profile is flown repeatedly with maybe only the times/dates changing. You don’t have to build the sortie profile from scratch each time, only the first time. Subsequently, you can simply add a Sortie Event set to a sortie and identify a new base time. All the other times will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>How do I build a Sortie Event Set?  Enter the individual events in the Sortie Events grid or the Sortie Events Builder tab with dates and times and then right-click in the grid and select, Save Sortie Event Set. A dialog box will appear asking for a name and description for the set. When completed, the set will be saved and the set name will appear in the Available Sortie Event Sets grid on the Sortie Events Builder tab.</p>
<p>How do I use a Sortie Event Set?  To add a set to a sortie in the Sortie Events Builder tab, highlight the set and click the Add Set to Sortie button. A dialog will appear requesting a date and time to offset. All the other sortie events will offset from that date and time. Once you set the times and click “OK” another dialog will appear that says “Some events in the set already exist in the Sortie”. You have three options but we recommend that you use “Yes” which wil replace all the sortie events.</p>
<p>How can I use a Sortie Event Set and still retain my original ARCT data?  When PEX sees an ARCT sortie event on your original sortie, the Add Set to Sortie dialog wil come up with the Sortie Event Set ARCT event pre-selected and the checkbox "Retain Original ARCT Data" deselected. If you want to apply your standard routing and retain the ARCT and associated (altitudes, call signs, etc.) then all you have to do is select the “Retain Original ARCT Data” and click OK.</p>
<p>How do I delete a Sortie Event Set?  Right-click on it and select Delete Sortie Event Set.</p>
<p>How do I clear the sortie events off a sortie?  Right-click on the sortie and select Clear Sortie Events on the Mission Builder/Standard View or the Sortie Events Builder tab. This deletes all except Show, Brief, Takeoff, Land, and Post Sortie End.</p>
<p>How do I freeze sortie event times so they don’t change?  Right-click Freeze/Unfreeze Date/Time. Freezing a date/time prevents cascade options from taking effect. Frozen date/times are displayed with a blue background. Checking the CT box wil do the same.</p>
<p>Schedule AR Tracks</p>
<p>How do I schedule Air Refueling (AR)?</p>
<p>Use Sortie Events to schedule the AR. In every case, enter the pertinent AR data (Cal Sign, Onload, Altitude, etc.) on the ARCP sortie event. AR Track Duration is calculated between the ARCP time and AREX time. In the case of a Reverse Track, enter the pertinent AR data on the first ARCP sortie event of the sequence and the Track Duration is calculated between the first ARCP and the final AR point in the sequence. There are four options for scheduling AR. Use the one that best suits your mission:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Simple. Schedule just an ARCP sortie event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard. Schedule ARIP, ARCP, and AREX sortie events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple ARs. Schedule the first one as a standard AR track (ARIP, ARCP, and AREX), insert some other, non-AR, sortie event(s) after the AREX, then add the next AR track (ARIP, ARCP, and AREX).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reverse AR. On the first ARCP sortie event, check the Reverse Track checkbox. Schedule the sequence as either:</p>
<ol>
<li>ARIP, ARCP, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP (if the time to the AREX is also scheduled/control ed)</li>
<li>ARIP, ARCP, ARIP (if the time to the AREX is not scheduled/control ed)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Scheduling Supervisors</p>
<p>Concept. PEX allows you to schedule up to three different kinds of squadron supervisors, e.g., SOF, Top 3, and Mobile. You decide as a squadron which three types to schedule. The supervisor schedule is displayed on the Mission Board, Commitments Board, and the scheduling reports.</p>
<p>How do I set it up?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first thing to do is to setup your squadron’s Letter of X in PEX so that PEX knows who your supervisors are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have created and assigned the certifications, go to the Mission Board&gt; Tools&gt; Options&gt; Squadron Preferences. In the Supervisor Type area, select one Supervisor Type per line, up to three, e.g., SOF, Mobile, and TOP 3. Then click OK. Now that PEX knows your desired Supervisor Types and who meets those Certifications, you can schedule them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s setup. How do I schedule them?</p>
<p>To schedule supervisors, go to Mission Board&gt; Tools&gt; Schedule Supervisors. A dialog will appear. Right-click in the grid and select Add Supervisor Commitment. Select a Supervisor Type, then in the Short Name list select the person you want to schedule. Final y, enter the length of the commitment, any remarks, and click on another row to save (if only one row is in view, click on the header to save). Once you have entered all supervisors’ commitments, click OK to close the dialog. To display or check the supervisor’s schedule, click on the Faces” icon on the toolbar.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting</p>
<p>A supervisor wil not appear in the supervisor drop down for one of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are not assigned an “is certified” status in Letter of X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are expired in the respective certification in Letter of X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are “decertified” with cause in the respective certification in Letter of X</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lock Schedule</p>
<p>Concept. After the flying schedule is built, you can lock key portions to prevent changes or at least require coordination between Operations and Maintenance before making the change. You can lock one sortie, a day, or a span of days. You can lock Takeoff Time, Land Time, SCL, Aircraft Configuration, MX Line Number, Tail Number, and SCL.</p>
<p>Permissions</p>
<p>PEXAdmin and squadron administrators.</p>
<p>How do I lock the schedule?  To lock a day or multiple days at once, display the day(s) you want to lock on the Mission Board, then click the Lock icon on the toolbar. To lock one sortie at a time, right-click on the sortie and select Lock Sortie.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    If you do not have a Tail # or MDS identified in the sortie line, those fields will not lock. Once you add the Tail # or MDS you will have to re-lock the sortie.</p>
<p>How do I unlock the schedule?  Once a schedule is locked, it can be unlocked only one sortie at a time. Right-click on the sortie and select "Unlock Sortie." Once unlocked, changes can be made and the sortie can be locked again.</p>
<p>Track Changes</p>
<p>Concept. While working in the MB, changes are not tracked until you “Commit” the mission (go firm). Once committed, when you make a change to a tracked item, PEX allows you to enter details about the change. To identify which items are tracked, go to Tools&gt; Options&gt; Squadron Preferences&gt; Set Change Notifications. Once the tracking data is entered, you can notify the change to personnel.</p>
<p>How do I commit missions?  Normal y, they should be committed when higher authority approves the schedule. To commit a mission, right-click in the Missions grid and select Commit Mission(s). This allows you to commit all or some missions on a day or a range of days.</p>
<p>My missions are committed. What happens now?  When you make a change to a tracked field and click off the mission (not just the sortie), PEX launches a change notification dialog where you type in why the change was made. In this dialog, fill in the Authorized By, Description, Item Affected, and Remarks, Effective Date (L), and Effective Time (L) fields. This data wil be sent to recipients and entered on your PEX-generated AF 2407. If you simply want to track this change, click OK. If you want to notify the change, continue reading.</p>
<p>How do I notify the change?  In the Mission Change dialog, click the Add Mission Crew button, then click OK. This will launch your email with the crew already addressed. Use your email software to add other recipients as desired. When complete, send the email.</p>
<p>Can I delete a committed mission?  No, once a mission is committed, it cannot be deleted, only canceled. Cancellation may be recorded as a mission change.</p>
<p>How do I cancel a mission?  To cancel a mission that has been committed, highlight the mission, right-click and select Cancel Mission or check the Cnx box on the Mission line. Once a mission is canceled, all sorties, location, aircraft, and personnel commitment records attached to that mission are cancelled too. Missions that are canceled are not editable except for the Cnx and Msn Cancel Cause columns. If the mission is not canceled, the Msn Cancel Cause field is not editable.</p>
<p>How do I un-cancel a mission?  Uncheck the Cnx checkbox in the Missions grid. When a mission is uncanceled, all associated sorties will be un-canceled and commitments will be re-engaged for personnel, aircraft, and locations.</p>
<p>How do I cancel a single sortie, not the entire mission?  Only sorties of committed missions may be cancelled. The cancel sortie checkbox, Cnx, is located in the Sortie grid. Once a sortie has been canceled, all location, aircraft, and personnel commitment records attached to that sortie are cancelled.</p>
<p>How do I un-cancel a sortie?  Un-cancel a sortie by un-checking the Cnx checkbox in the Sorties grid. When a sortie is un-canceled, all commitments are re-engaged. A sortie can be un-canceled if its mission is not canceled.</p>
<p>Tail Number Denial</p>
<p>Concept. You can hide aircraft tail numbers from the crew until they are in a "Go” status. The purpose of this feature is to prevent crew from stepping to the aircraft before accomplishing required items. This is a completely manual process not linked to the PEX Go/No-Go page.</p>
<p>How do I set this up?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the MB, go to View&gt; and unselect Show Tail Numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the MB, go to Tools&gt; Options&gt; Squadron, and enable Auto No-Go. When you add people to sorties, PEX will automatically mark their manual No-Go box.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I use it?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add people to sorties as you normal y would. They come in with the manual No-Go box checked. The sortie tail number is hidden if anyone on the crew is marked No-Go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify a person has completed all required actions for proceeding to the aircraft and uncheck their box. For one or two person crews, the box can be unchecked from the MB Sorties grid. For crews of three or more, the box must be unchecked in the Flying Schedule&gt; Crew tab&gt; Crew Details dialog. Only the following permission roles can uncheck the box: Ops Desk, Training Auditor/Arms, Administrator, and Flight Schedulers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When all crew on a sortie have unchecked No-Go boxes, the tail number will display.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How does this affect Maintenance?  The MX Scheduling permission role has permission to see tail numbers at all times.</p>
<p>Export to TAP</p>
<p>Concept. This function allows you to export PEX mission data to a file that can be imported by the TBMCS</p>
<p>(Theater Battle Management Core Systems) Force Level TAP (Theater Air Planner). Use this function to add missions developed in PEX to the Air Tasking Order (ATO). This function is mostly used by Special Forces.</p>
<p>How do I use it?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build your missions/sorties normally in PEX. Enter as much TAP data as you have for the sortie on each of the sortie events you want to export to TAP. Check the Sortie Event "CT" block for sortie events with control times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PEX data exported to the TAP file comes from the following fields:</p>

<p>!!! Note
    PEX automatically removes dashes from MDSs. E.g., "MC-130" will export as "MC130".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When ready to create the TAP export file, in the PEX MB, select "Tools, Export to TAP…" The "Export to TAP" dialog will appear. The dialog will display all the same missions/sorties displayed on the Mission Board.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using the "Export TAP File Location/Name" browse button, select the location and name to save the file about to be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(If known) Type in the ATO ID, ACO, and Revision #.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter your ATO Unit ID and Service. Click "Save Settings" to enter this Unit ID and Service for all your missions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the missions you want exported to the file. Each PEX mission selected wil generate an "AIRMSN" record on the export file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From among the missions you select for export, select the events you want to export. Clicking the "Show only CT Events" box wil filter your list down to just events that have control times. Each PEX sortie event selected wil generate a "TASK" record on the export file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have all the missions and events selected, click "Export." The generated file can be imported by TAP.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Distance, Time, and Fuel</p>
<p>Concept. The Mission Board, Sortie Events grid displays the exact distance, approximate time, and approximate fuel between event points. It also provides totals of all the above in the Post Sortie End line.</p>
<p>These figures provide the scheduler an estimate of fuel required for the sortie. It does not, obviously, replace detailed crew mission planning.</p>
<p>How do I set this up?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Aircraft Module. In the Aircraft MDS grid, enter the average speed (KTAS) and average fuel flow for the MDS. Fuel flow can be entered as any amount per hour, e.g., pounds per hour or gal ons per hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locations Module. Enter latitudes and longitudes for all your flying locations or at least the ones you use frequently.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, how do I use it?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Schedule sortie events the way you normally do, making sure a location is specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distance. PEX calculates the great circle distance (NM) between your sortie event points. If an event has no location specified or the location has all zeroes for the lat/long, PEX wil skip over that event and calculate the distance to the next event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time. PEX divides the distance by the average speed to derive a calculated (approximate) time, then PEX uses the greater of Calculated Time or Scheduled Time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the Calculated Time between two Sortie Events is less than the Scheduled Time, PEX wil use the Scheduled Time. For example, if PEX calculates it wil take 15 minutes to get somewhere but you schedule 30 minutes, PEX wil use 30 minutes as the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Calculated Time between two Sortie Events is more than the Scheduled Time, PEX uses the Calculated Time. For example, if PEX calculates it will take 15 minutes to get somewhere but you schedule only 10 minutes, PEX wil 15 minutes as the time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fuel. PEX multiplies the time by the average fuel flow to calculate the approximate fuel (pounds or gal ons depending on how the fuel flow was entered).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the bottom-line (Post Sortie End) sortie event to get an idea of how much fuel is needed for the sortie.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<p>Deconfliction. As you add people and aircraft to the schedule, PEX compares the mission start date/time and the mission end date/time to other commitments. If there are conflicts, a message box will appear that asks, "Possible conflicts. Do you still want to add item?” If you select “Yes”, the person or aircraft will be added to the schedule.</p>
<p>Can I use the MB for display?  The Squadron Daily Schedule module was designed as a replacement for using the MB as a flight schedule display. However, if you prefer to use the MB in a Full Screen, Auto-Refresh mode, select File&gt; Ful Screen. While in Ful Screen mode, the record of interest is not indicated by a dark blue line like it normally is, but all MB functionality is available. To exit Ful Screen, hold down the Alt key and hit F twice.</p>
<p>Can I use the MB for JTAC Scheduling?  Yes, you should. Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) missions could be scheduled using the Commitments Board (CB); however, better functionality is obtained by using the MB.</p>
<p>Using the MB, you can copy and paste large Remarks into the Mission Remarks field. With the CB, the Remarks have to be copied one line at a time. Using the MB, you generate a Sortie Details Report on My Page, where your JTAC personnel can see what they are scheduled for and the other personnel on the mission (neither of which is obtained by using the CB).</p>
<p>What do the colored names mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Red indicates overdue a Priority 1 training task (supervision required)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orange indicates manual No-Go</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blue indicates both of the above</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How do I enter actual takeoff and land times?  Click on the “clock with an A” icon and the actual time fields wil display in the Sortie grid. If you want to enter the current time, just click in the time field. If you want to change it from current time, click in the field and edit. If the time has already been saved, you will need to right-click on the time field and select “Adjust Actual” then you can change the times. This is to prevent accidental changes. If you click on the field for sorties at least one day in the past it will put scheduled time in the field.</p>
<p>Can I filter the list of sorties?  Yes, click on the Filter icon. You can filter by MDS, Sortie Type, or both. This is useful if you want to filter out simulators and/or alert sorties.</p>
<p>What do the other icons do?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>M Icon with a slash through it - will hide the Mission grid if you have the Fighter view Selected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The M icon with a line up and down - expands the Mission grid in the Standard view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The S icon with a line up and down - expands the Sorties grid in the Standard view</p>

<h2 id="personnel-availability">Personnel Availability<a class="headerlink" href="#personnel-availability" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Displaying Personnel Availability Data</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select a squadron in the Squadron drop-down list that has scheduled availability periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a person from the Personnel drop-down list. When a person is selected, the Availability grid will display the selected person’s availability data from the database and the date it was last updated. In the Availability grid, ToolTip notations on the Date field will list the day of the week/Julian Scheduling date and ToolTips on the Availability Type code field will list the Availability Type Description.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Updating Personnel Availability Electronically</p>
<p>This is a three-step process. First, create a Personnel Availability Import File and send it to your personnel. Second, as the files are returned completed, you store them in a folder. Third, when you are ready, import the data.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creating the Personnel Availability Import File. This is a single file that you will send out to your squadron personnel where they can fill in, by month, when and how they are available. The file will automatically include your squadron's Availability Periods and Availability Types. Select "Tools, Create Import File. ." to launch the dialog. Then, select the Month/Year for which you want availability entered and click "Create File." The file will automatically be saved to Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Outgoing folder unless you specify otherwise. Now that the file is created, use your Email software to send it to your personnel. The file includes instructions on how to fill it out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storing Filled-In Import Files. As your personnel return the files filled in with their availability, save them to Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming folder or as desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Importing Personnel Availability Files. Select the squadron for which you want to import personnel availability data. Then, select "Tools, Import Availability. ." to launch the dialog. Click "Select Files" to see a list of all the files available for import, these files will normally be located at Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming folder unless you have specified otherwise. Once you have selected your desired files, normally select all of them, click OK. The selected files will be listed and you can then click "Import." Once a file has been successfully read and entered into the PEX database, the file will be automatically renamed "Imported" + the original file name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Changes. Personnel can use the same import file to update availability data they previously sent you. They simply re-do their availability for the month and send it to you. You will know they are changing their availability by receipt of a another file for the same month. When you import the updated file, it will delete their previous inputs for the month and replace it with the new.</p>
<p>Errors. A log file is created each time files are imported. If personnel make errors filling out the import file, the specific error is listed so you can go into the file and fix it. Any file with errors will remain in the Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming directory until successfully imported.</p>
<p>Adding Personnel Availability Data Manually</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For one or few days: Select the days on the calendar in the Select By Day section and click Add. This wil move the selected day to the Selected Days list box. Or,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For many days, use the Select by Days of Week grouping:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the Date Span inside of which the available days will fall.</li>
<li>Select the All Days radio button to set all of the days in the Date Span inside the Selected Days window or select the By Day radio button to set multiple instances of a certain day, and select the check boxes of the days to place in the Selected Days list.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the days are selected, set period availability by highlighting the days in the Selected Days list. The highlighting may be done individually or all days may be highlighted using the Select all button. The Unselect All button will remove the highlighting from all highlighted days in the list box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Set Availability group to assign availability either All Day or By Period, the periods as Hard or Soft, and the Availability Types. Click Add to send the date(s) and availability to the Availability grid.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Select Apply to save the data to the database.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    The meaning of Hard and Soft is unit-defined. E.g., Hard could mean the crewmember will show up for whatever is scheduled without the scheduler double-checking. Soft could mean that the crewmember is probably available but the scheduler should check before relying on the crewmember to actual y show up.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    Availability Types are unit-defined in Setup, Validation.</p>
<p>Removing Personnel Availability Data Manually</p>
<p>Remove days from the Availability grid by selecting one or more days and pressing the Remove button. The dates will be moved from the Availability grid to the Selected Days list. To remove a day completely, highlight it and click Remove in the Selected Days group. To change the availability, see next paragraph.</p>
<p>Editing Personnel Availability Data Manually</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the date in the Availability grid, and click the Remove button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date will be removed from the Availability grid and added to the Selected Days list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the day in the list and set the Period Availability, then select Hard or Soft and Availability Type for the period(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Add button to add the date to the Availability grid.</p>
</li>

<p>RPA Schedule Basics</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The RPA Schedule module schedules crews onto RPA Missions using Vulnerability or “Vul” Periods. The actual missions are created in the Flying Schedule (or Mission Board). Build the Vulnerability Periods your unit is responsible for and assign crew members to cover the entire Vulnerability Period.</p>
<p>Permissions</p>
<p>Ops Desk, Flight Scheduling or Administrator.</p>
<p>Module Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A squadron must select "Create mission as RPA mission." RPA Missions are created in Flying Schedule &gt; Sorties or in Mission Board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once created, RPA Missions do not display in Flying Schedule &gt; Crew, they display in the RPA Schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only missions scheduled as RPA missions wil display in the RPA Schedule.</p>

<p>Legend: Display the legend defining Vulnerability Period / Crew Coverage coding.</p>
<p><img alt="binders" src="img/Scheduling/RPA%20Coverage%20Legend.jpg" style="height:50%;width:50%" /></p>
<p>Green = <em>overall coverage</em>. This coverage bar indicates the portions of the Vulnerability Period that are collectively covered by that respective role.</p>
<p>Orange = <em>Not covered</em>. This coverage bar indicates the portions of the Vulnerability Period that are collectively NOT covered by that respective role.</p>
<p>Blue = <em>Individual coverage</em>. This coverage bar indicates the portions of the Vulnerability Period that are covered by that individual person/role.</p>
<p>Red = <em>Individual coverage that is outside of the Vulnerability Period</em>. This is displayed in the event you want to adjust coverage.</p>
<p>Nothing = Indicate that the specific role is not covered for that indicated span of the Vulnerability Period.</p>
<p>These colors quickly identify whether the personnel you have scheduled can fully cover the entire Vulnerability period. If for example you see a partial Green and then Orange color, the person is only able to cover a portion of the shift and the orange portion of the mission is not covered. If that is the case, drag/drop another person to complete the required Vulnerability Period.</p>

<p>Shift Schedule Basics</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Shifts Scheduler module allows you to schedule personnel to shifts. You can create shifts for any length of time assigned to a date range. You can create unit specific shift names, shift types, crew compositions, background colors to represent a specific shift types and create and manage shift patterns which support a rotational and recurring shift.</p>
<p>Permissions</p>
<p>Ground Scheduling, and Administrator: can add/edit/delete shift schedules. Ops Desk, Ops Staff, SOF, Training Admin, Course Admin, CT Admin and Task List Admin: can view but not make changes.</p>
<p>Controls</p>
<p>Access these procedures by navigating from the PEX main menu to Scheduling &gt; Shift Scheduler.</p>

<p>Workflow</p>
<p>Shift Schedule Setup</p>
<p>Squadron Management Setup</p>
<p>Setup- Personnel module</p>
<p>!!! Note
    the Personnel module supports the shift schedule module by returning MDS, CP, Qual code, DAFSC and/or teams for unit personnel based on a scheduler’s filter choices within the shift schedule.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to Setup &gt; Personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To view a Squadron roster to ensure all personnel have a CP, Qual codes, DAFSC and/or teams perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on Roster tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the left side (select/order fields) click on DAFSC, Teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the right side (select sections and types) click on MDS Qual, LoX; Certifications and Remarks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click print/export.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A roster will be created indicating personnel who have their Personnel information filled in and when it was last updated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If for some reason, personnel don’t have their CP/Qual/DAFSC filled in, perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Within the Details tab, select a short name, and enter a DAFSC for the person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use teams, identify personnel using their short name to identify the team they belong to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the Quals tab, select a short name, and ensure the individual has a primary crew position and qualifications identified. If not enter it within this tab.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Setup- Letter of X module</p>
<p>!!! Note
    if you plan to use certifications to schedule personnel, ensure personnel are identified within the LoX module as having certifications.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to Ops and select Letter of X module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select radio button for Personnel Filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a Personnel filter from the drop down menu to view personnel in your squadron.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within view Template grid; ensure the correct Squadron displays.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Click Load letter of X; personnel will appear on right side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personnel with certifications will have an X displayed within the status column for the certification that is applicable to the person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Setup- Identify conflicts</p>
<p>!!! Note
    If you want PEX to warn you about commitments that conflict with a shift (e.g., leaves, TDY), you can indicate that within the Validation module.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to Setup &gt; Validation &gt; Scheduling &gt; Commitments Board &gt; Personnel Commitment Type table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the Listings grid, each Personnel Commitment Type has a ‘Conflicts with Shift’ column which can be checked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scheduling a person on a shift and a checked commitment type with overlapping times will generate a conflict warning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exit the module.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Setup- Shift Types</p>
<p>!!! Note
    Shift types is the category of shifts (e.g., days, swings, UTA, exercise). Additionally, it identifies the color of the shift type which is displayed on the Shift Schedule calendar.</p>
<ol>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click off the line to save and click OK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Setup- Shift Template</p>
<p>!!! Note
    A Shift Template is a standardized template which can be used over and over again as a model for subsequent shifts: same start time, same end time, etc.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to Scheduling and select shift schedule</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the setup tab</p>
</li>

    A Crew Template is the crew positions (CPs) and roles you need for a shift. You can add a shift, add a crew template onto the shift, and then fill in/select the people later. Additionally, once a crew template has been created, you can only edit its name and description, not the CPs or roles. It is best to delete it, if the entire template needs modifications (see Delete instructions below).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Within the Shifts Tab, select any date, right click and select Add Template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the crew to the shift by using your filters; select CP and Quals needed and or DAFSCs or certifications needed for the shift.</p>

<li>
<p>Times. "(L)" times on the schedule are local times at the location specified, e.g., landing at KHIF at 09:00 (L) is Hill AFB local time. Ground events and the supervisor schedule display the local time of the user logged in based on their location. The celestial data (L) time is also the local time of the PEX user logged in. User locations are set in the Users and Permissions module.</p>
</li>
<li>

To setup this feature, go to the Mission Board, Tools, Options, Squadron Preferences tab, and select the items to track (show in red) if changed. Later, commit the schedule as normal. If any tracked item changes after the commit, it will show in red on the schedule. Certain calculated values (i.e., Pattern Time and AR Track Duration) will never show red, even if they changed. Neither wil the following values show in red: Actual Takeoff Time, Actual Land Time, and a person's Weather Category ("WX").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Air Refueling (AR) Data. PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events: ARIP, ARET, ARCP, ARCT, AREX, AREXIT, and ARINFO. If it finds any of them, they wil appear on the schedule. AREX or AREXIT defines the end of a sequence of AR events, e.g., ARIP, ARCP, and AREX would define a single AR sequence. Within an AR sequence, the first supporting data entered against any of the AR events wil show up on the schedule. For example, if you load some of the AR data (Seq #, Alt, Rz Type, for example) on the ARIP line and the rest (Onload, Priority, for example) on the ARCP line, that will work fine. If you load the same type of data, e.g., Seq #, on two different lines within the same sequence, the schedule wil print only the first one. For example, if you enter Sequence Number "1201" on the ARIP line and "1502" on the ARCP line; it's the "1201" that wil show up. Bottom-line, enter the supporting data on any line of the AR sequence but only once. AR track duration is calculated as the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the AREX sortie events. Reverse Track. Define a Reverse AR track in PEX by checking the ”Reverse Track” box on the first ”AREX” sortie event. PEX wil then disregard the second AREX and ARCP times and use the final ARIP time as real AREX time. PEX assumes a reverse AR track has the following sortie events sequence: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP. AR Track duration is the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the final AREX (which is really the geographic ARIP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Airspace and Range Data. The flying schedules (except Custom Schedule) provide options to show airspace/range Name, Entry Time, IP (Initial Point) Time, and/or Exit Time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you use the Sortie Events Builder tab to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events to populate the following airspace/range data:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Entry time: "LL EP", "Area Entry", and "ALTN EP"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IP time: "IP" (but will display only if followed by LL EX, Area Exit, or ALTN EX) 3) Exit time: "LL EX", "Area Exit", and "ALTN EX"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>!!! Note
    If the Entry, IP, and Exit locations are the same (e.g., IR 275), PEX will list the times on one line. If the locations are different (e.g., IR 175 PtA, IR 175 IP, and IR 175 PtZ), PEX will list the times on separate lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use the Mission Builder tab, Sorties grid, Airspace columns to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX include whatever you schedule for airspace/range Start Time and End Time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use the Custom Schedule report, the airspace process is simpler and more generic. Any PEX Sortie Event or Airspace that you schedule between the Takeoff and Land times, that has a Location Name specified, wil show up on the report when you select Location, Airspace Entry, or Airspace Exit. Exit/End Time is based on Sortie Event Duration or Airspace End Time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miscellaneous.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If "IAF" is entered as a sortie event on the Bomber Schedule, the IAF time wil display on the schedule and "Pattern Time" wil calculate as the time between the IAF time and Land time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If ”Bus” is entered as a sortie event, the ”Bus” local time will show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crew will show up in the same order as on the Flying Schedule/Crew module. If the order is not as desired on this report, make the change on the Flying Schedule&gt; Crew tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person is assigned a WX Cat (Personnel&gt; Quals &amp; Certs), the fighter schedule will display the category in parentheses to the right of the crew position. This applies when the person has a MDS qualification matching that scheduled on the sortie. If the MDS is different, the parentheses are empty.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Range Report</p>
<p>Concept. The Range Report is used to list to which airspaces aircraft are going. The report is found at Scheduling&gt; Reports&gt; Range Report. It can be used by the squadron to see where the sorties are going. It can be used by the range controllers to see the schedule of aircraft coming to the range.</p>
<p>How do I run the report?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick where you have your locations sourced, usually PEX</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick the date range of interest and whether you want to see the times in Local or Zulu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick the unit(s) and MDS(s) of interest. Normal y, a unit would select only their squadron and MDS. A range controller would select all units and MDSs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick the Location Types and specific Locations of interest. Normally, a unit would select all Locations. A range controller would select only their ranges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick the Load Types of interest. The report wil show the load items carried on the aircraft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick if you want Alert, TDY, Cancelled, or Spare sorties to show up. Normally, a range controller will not be interested in Alert, Cancelled, or Spare sorties. Those sorties don’t make it to the range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, pick desired additional columns to display on the report. “Proj” is the Range Project Number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click PDF or Excel. The report is ordered by range entry time “ENT.”</p>

<img alt="binders" src="img/Scheduling/Pex%20data%20entry%202.png" style="height:100%;width:100%" /></p>
<p>!!! Note
    The Mission Board column names are the default ones. Yours may be different. If you can’t find these columns in the Mission Builder, they’ve probably been changed. Go to Setup &gt; Labels &gt; select your squadron. At the “interfaces” grid highlight Scheduling-Mission Board-Mission Builder, locate the default label text and note the Override Label Text – this is the column name you’ll see in the mission builder tab.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    To get a “load time” you must first add a specific sortie event. Go to Setup &gt; Validation &gt; Scheduling &gt; Mission Board &gt; Sortie Event, and add “MSN LOAD” (it must be spelled this way). At the Mission Board &gt; Sortie Events Builder &gt; Available Sortie events, you should now see MSN LOAD. Add this sortie event to your sortie and give it a time. It’ll now show up on the AFSOC Form 40.</p>
<p>!!! Note
    To get mission loads they must first be added in the Weapons module, then scheduled on the Flying Schedule &gt; Loads tab. They’ll now show up on the AFSOC Form 40.</p>
<p>Flying Schedules</p>
<p>How to Use. These are the new schedules, found under "Scheduling, Reports" in both ePEX and WinPEX (the screen with the DoD logo):</p>
<p>!!! Note
    When launching the reports in Excel, on the Windows Vista operating system, on the Windows File Download dialog, "Save" the report first, do not "Open" it directly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the format of the schedule you want: Fighter Schedule or Bomber Schedule.</li>
<li>
<p>Start on the "Sorties" tab and select which sorties you want to appear on the schedule:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the date range and whether you want times displayed in Local or Zulu. Locations with no Zulu Rule or DST Offset entered in the PEX Locations module will also display in Zulu only.</li>
<li>Select the squadron(s) from which you want sorties. Select the MDS(s) you want to appear. Pick whether you want Alert, TDY, Cancelled, and/or Spare sorties to appear. (Alert, TDY, and Cancelled are set in the Mission Board in the Missions grid. Spare sorties are created by including "sp" anywhere in the Mission Board Line Number field, e.g., "601sp".)</li>
<li>Select "Show Only Actual Sorties" to get an after-action report of what actually flew (sorties with Actual Takeoff and Land times entered on the Mission Board) in actual takeoff order.</li>
<li>Select "BASH Window" to display the Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazard window of time. This window is setup in the Squadrons module.</li>
<li>Finally, in the "Display" area, pick the columns you want to appear on the schedule.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move on to the "Ground" tab and select what ground scheduling data (Personnel Commitments) you want to appear.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the "Show" area, select whether to even display the "Ground" data at all and whether to label the entire schedule as "SECRET."</li>
<li>Select the squadron(s) from which you want personnel commitments to appear.</li>
<li>Final y, select the supervisor types and commitment types you want to appear.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select "PDF" to get an Adobe Acrobat read-only type file or "Excel" to get Microsoft editable file.</p>
</li>
<li>Your selections for each schedule (e.g., Fighter or Bomber) are saved as user preferences.</li>
<li>Times. "(L)" times on the schedule are local times at the location specified, e.g., landing at KHIF at 09:00 ( L) is Hill AFB local time. Ground events and the supervisor schedule display the local time of the user logged in based on their location. The celestial data ( L) time is also the local time of the PEX user logged in. User locations are set in the Users and Permissions module.</li>
<li>Changes in Red. The schedule can show in red, data that has changed since the schedule was committed. To setup this feature, go to the Mission Board, Tools, Options, Squadron Preferences tab, and select the items to track (show in red) if changed. Later, commit the schedule as normal. If any tracked item changes after the commit, it will show in red on the schedule. Certain calculated values (i.e., Pattern Time and AR Track Duration) will never show red, even if they changed. Neither will the following values show in red: Actual Takeoff Time, Actual Land Time, and a person's Weather Category ("WX").</li>
<li>
<p>Air Refueling (AR) Data. PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events: ARIP, ARET, ARCP, ARCT, AREX, AREXIT, and ARINFO. If it finds any of them, they wil appear on the schedule. AREX or AREXIT defines the end of a sequence of AR events, e.g., ARIP, ARCP, and AREX would define a single AR sequence. Within an AR sequence, the first supporting data entered against any of the AR events wil show up on the schedule. For example, if you load some of the AR data (Seq #, Alt, Rz Type, for example) on the ARIP line and the rest (Onload, Priority, for example) on the ARCP line, that will work fine. If you load the same type of data, e.g., Seq #, on two different lines within the same sequence, the schedule will print only the first one. For example, if you enter Sequence Number "1201" on the ARIP line and "1502" on the ARCP line; it's the "1201" that wil show up. Bottom-line, enter the supporting data on any line of the AR sequence but only once. AR track duration is calculated as the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the AREX sortie events.</p>
<p>Reverse Track. Define a Reverse AR track in PEX by checking the ”Reverse Track” box on the first ”AREX” sortie event. PEX will then disregard the second AREX and ARCP times and use the final ARIP time as real AREX time. PEX assumes a reverse AR track has the following sortie events sequence: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP. AR Track duration is the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the final AREX (which is really the geographic ARIP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Airspace and Range Data. The flying schedules (except Custom Schedule) provide options to show airspace/range Name, Entry Time, IP (Initial Point) Time, and/or Exit Time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you use the Sortie Events Builder tab to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events to populate the following airspace/range data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Entry time: "LL EP", "Area Entry", and "ALTN EP"</li>
<li>IP time: "IP" (but will display only if followed by LL EX, Area Exit, or ALTN EX) 3) Exit time: "LL EX", "Area Exit", and "ALTN EX"
!!! Note
    If the Entry, IP, and Exit locations are the same (e.g., IR 275), PEX wil list the times on one line. If the locations are different (e.g., IR 175 PtA, IR 175 IP, and IR 175 PtZ), PEX will list the times on separate lines.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use the Mission Builder tab, Sorties grid, Airspace columns to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX include whatever you schedule for airspace/range Start Time and End Time.</p>
</li>
<li>If you use the Custom Schedule report, the airspace process is simpler and more generic. Any PEX Sortie Event or Airspace that you schedule between the Takeoff and Land times, that has a Location Name specified, wil show up on the report when you select Location, Airspace Entry, or Airspace Exit. Exit/End Time is based on Sortie Event Duration or Airspace End Time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miscellaneous.</p>
<ol>
<li>If "IAF" is entered as a sortie event, the IAF time wil display on the schedule and "Pattern Time" will calculate as the time between the IAF time and Land time.</li>
<li>If ”Bus” is entered as a sortie event, the ”Bus” local time will show up in Remarks.</li>
<li>A cancelled sortie will show up with a gray background and ”CANX” in the Mission Number field.</li>
<li>Crew will show up in the same order as on the Mission Board/Flying Schedule module. If the order is not as desired on this report, make the change on the Mission Board/Flying Schedule module.</li>
<li>If a person is assigned a WX Cat (Personnel&gt; Quals &amp; Certs), the fighter schedule will display the category in parentheses to the right of the crew position. This applies when the person has a MDS qualification matching that scheduled on the sortie. If the MDS is different, the parentheses are empty.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<p>Scheduler Basics</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Scheduler module is in development to replace many of the existing scheduling modules, in order to achieve a single workspace to build schedules. Schedules can be generated for Missions, Production Request or Events. Currently, data you input into the Scheduler module does not feed into any other part of PEX (e.g., the My Page, Long Range Scheduler module, Shift Schedule or Commitments Board), it does however communicate with the Go/NoGo module.</p>
<p>Permissions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PEX Administrator and Scheduling Administrator: can build/edit/delete Missions, Events, Production Requests, and can work with ful access within the module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scheduler Read Only: allows users to view the schedule only.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Module Notes</p>
<p>The Scheduler module is only accessible in ePEX.</p>
<p>To add a location in Scheduler, the location must be established within PEX via the Locations module.</p>
<p>Controls</p>
<p>The Scheduler is accessed from the PEX navigation panel &gt; Scheduling &gt; Scheduler.</p>

<p>!!! Note
    Categories are used to determine in which reports events and sub-events will appear. Also the category determines how the event or sub-event will appear or be handled on the report. It is a good practice to assigned categories to the events (Missions, Events, or Production Requests) and then save them as event templates or create Missions, Events, or Production Request templates with categories assigned correctly. This wil ensure consistency in scheduling and report content.</p>

<p>The Hierarchy view is organized into a tree-like structure and can be used on Mission, Events or Production Requests. The hierarchy view uses “Parent/Child” relational records. The relationship of an event (parent), mandates that each child (sub event), has only one parent record; whereas a parent record can have one or more child records. This view is helpful to keep track of “parent” events that have multiple “child” events or sub-events and the resources assigned to the event which can be people, aircraft or a resource template.</p>

<p>Scheduler Mission - Functions</p>
<p>The following describes features and functionality in flying operations events; such as missions and sorties. Features and functionality common to all types of events are covered in Scheduler Functions - Common and Scheduler Functions - Event.</p>
<p>Add a Mission</p>
<p>!!! Note
    The difference between a Mission and a Sortie - Sorties belong to a Mission. For example, a Mission could be a four-ship formation (four Sorties), or a three-leg trip (three sorties), or a single-sortie mission. In the Scheduler, you will create the Mission first then add Sorties to it. In the Scheduler module, Sorties are listed in Sub Events.</p>
<p>!!! caution
    Unlike the PEX Mission Board, the scheduler module has no logic to keep the Sorties and Missions synchronized. With this Scheduler module it is not recommended to build Sorties completely outside the date range of the Mission. You should manually synchronize the Mission Start Date/Time with the first Sortie’s Takeoff Date/Time. The Mission End Date/Time should be kept manually synchronized with the last Sortie’s Land Date/Time. Not doing so wil make your schedule difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Single-sortie Mission</p>

<li>Select Offset.</li>
<li>When chosen, that option will give the ability to offset the Sub Event’s start or end time from the parent’s (Mission) start or end time.</li>
<li>It also allows a duration for the sub event to be chosen by selecting a duration time from the drop down (e.g., 15 minutes).</li>
<li>If the parent’s start or end time is modified, the Sub Event start and end times will be recalculated.</li>
</ol>
