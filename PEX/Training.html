<p>The Continuation Training module allows Training Managers to track personnel’s assigned continuation training requirements for an established training cycle. It is set up so that training assignments can be done via an Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) training import, HQ CT file import, and/or by manually assigning PEX generated Unit-Level Training tasks to personnel.</p>
<h3 id="permissions">Permissions<a class="headerlink" href="#permissions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>New in 5.16.1 A new role of ARMS Import/Export is added, and Training Auditor/ARMS is renamed to Training Auditor.</p>
<p>Several permission roles can access the Continuation Training module and perform administrative functions, in addition to PEX Admin and Administrator. The pseudo-role Supervisor also has limited functions in the CT module, and any Basic User can access the module for the purpose of submitting Training Accomplishment Reports (TARs) via the Reporting tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ARMS Import/Export is required to access the ARMS tab. This role cannot be assigned to a Joint Use account, i.e., the user must be associated to a Personnel record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training Administrator can perform any function in the CT module except audit TARs and access the ARMS tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training CT Administrator can perform any function in the CT module except audit TARs, setup and use the TACTICS tab, and access the ARMS tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training Auditor (previously Training Auditor/ARMS) can audit TARs for both unit-level and ARMS tasks, import and export ARMS data, as well as view Training Tasks and Overview tabs. It cannot access the ARMS tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic User can access and use the Training Tasks tab within the module, as well as submit TARs for squadron personnel via the Reporting tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supervisor is a pseudo-role which is assigned in the Personnel module. In addition to the functions of Basic Users, individuals assigned as a supervisor can also the access the CT tab of their supervisees’ training folders from which they can view subordinate’s CT status, generate daily and monthly TAR reports and view the status of tasks reported but not yet updated in PEX displays. If the unit has set up the CT module to allow it, supervisors may also audit TARs of their supervisees from within the training folder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="module-notes">Module Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#module-notes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The CT module interfaces with and uses data from the Personnel module. For ARMS tasks, the ARMS Personnel imports add/overwrite the necessary Personnel dat1. For unit-level tasks, both local and HQ, units must ensure the fol owing is completed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quals tab – Personnel’s qualifications are set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Details or Personnel tab – Personnel’s Service status is set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup tab – The appropriate Qualification Status codes in the Aircrew Qualification Code table are identified as “Is Qualified.” This is necessary to support setup of “Check Assigned” function within the CT module.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="overview">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>New in PEX 5.16.1. PEX now includes connectivity to ARMS via Web Services. This allows users to easily exchange data between ARMS and PEX without using the process of importing data using ARMS-generated CSV files and exporting data using ODA3. This CSV/Virtual Account process remains in place, but has been updated.</p>
<p>The ARMS tab is used to setup the PEX interface with ARMS to send data from ARMS to PEX, and PEX to ARMS.</p>
<p>There are two interface functions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Send validated personnel, personnel flying hours, and training data from ARMS to PEX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send audited training accomplishments and AFTO 781 data from PEX to ARMS.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two interface methods.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CSV/Virtual Account. This is the legacy method used in previous versions of PEX.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CSV. Export data from ARMS into a CSV file, then manually import the file into PEX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual Account. Export the data from PEX to ARMS using a virtual account. Due to the USAF requirement for two-factor authentication, this option may sunset, or become unavailable, in the near future. If Virtual Accounts are unavailable export data using Web Services described next.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web Services. Establish a direct connection/interface between PEX and ARMS. Once configured, the import and export are respectively accomplished by simply clicking the Begin Import and Begin Export buttons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the CSV/Virtual Account process remains essentially the same, both the interface and permission roles have been revised. Persons using the CSV/Virtual Account method should thoroughly review this topic before attempting import or export.</p>
<p>The PEX CSV/Virtual Account and Web Services imports for Personnel and Training behave differently. With the CSV/Virtual Account method, Personnel and Training CSV imports are a complete download from ARMS every time. PEX “wipes” and replaces person training assignments data on every import. ARMS Web Services, on the other hand, only import Personnel and Training records which have been updated in ARMS since the Zulu date specified in the Web Service Imports dialog. For example; Personnel - Import records updated in ARMS since (date) Z.</p>
<p>!!! note NOTE
    ARMS Web Services returns all squadron personnel in each Training import, as ARMS refreshes daily to Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS) dat1. As a result, each Web Services Training import into PEX updates all persons' Aviation Service data in Personnel and Z-004 ASC Term Date.</p>
<p>Users using the Web Services method must configure the CSV/Virtual Account method as well. The CSV/Virtual Account method is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a squadron is starting to use PEX for the first time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the first training import at the start of each training cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the first training import after migration to 5.16.1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="permissions_1">Permissions<a class="headerlink" href="#permissions_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ARMS Import/Export is a new permission role. This role allows access to the Continuation Training &gt; ARMS tab and the Import, Export, and Setup buttons. Therefore, this applies to both CSV/Virtual Account method and new Web Services method</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training Auditor is the renamed Auditor/ARMS role. Functionality remains unchanged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>!!! NOTE
    Both ARMS Import/Export and Training Auditor roles are required in order to export or import ARMS dat1. For security reasons, the Administrator role alone does not give the ability to import or export ARMS dat1.</p>

<h3 id="rules">Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users using only the CSV/Virtual Account method can disregard the Web Services specific information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can choose an override method when actually importing and exporting (from the Begin Import and Begin Export buttons). It is recommended users choose the default method they will routinely use, then override as required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users using either the CSV/Virtual Account or Web Services method must have both ARMS Import/Export and Training Auditor permissions as described above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 5.16.1 migration, PEX automatically sets squadron methods to CSV Imports and ODAC Exports.</p>

<p>Web Services Network Setup Interface</p>
<p>Web services utilizes Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Authentication, which requires certificate information in the form of a Thumbprint for the PEX Service Host (PSH) server. The ARMS Program Management Office requires certificate information in the form of a Thumbprint for each PSH server. Here, the term "PSH Admin" refers to the local person or persons who administer the PEX Service Host. Typically, this is the local PEX Administrator in conjunction with the local communications squadron.</p>
<ol>

<p>The PSH Admin:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Coordinates with the PEX Help Desk to send them:</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The designated HARM office for the PEX database:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enters the certificate Thumbprint in the Continuation Training &gt; ARMS tab &gt; Settings page. The Thumbprint has to be entered only once for the database. The Thumbprint is then visible to, and used by, every squadron in the database.</li>

<p>Click Begin Import.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For squadrons importing via Web Services, the Web Service Imports window will open.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Web Service imports require the Zulu Dates of the last successful imports of Personnel and Training records.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ARMS Web Services only import Personnel and Training records which have been changed in ARMS since the Zulu date specified in the Web Service Imports dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blank dates indicate the squadron has not yet completed a Web Services import for that data type (Personnel or Training). To ensure a squadron's first web service import includes all records changed in ARMS since the squadron's last CSV import, refer to the log file for the squadron's last successful CSV import for each data type. At the top of each log file locate the "Data Downloaded from ARMS" date. This is the date/time of the last ARMS import.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the last import was completed in PEX v5.16.1 or later, the date/time is in Zulu. You can enter that date as it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the last import was completed in PEX v5.16.0 or earlier, the date/time is in Local time. You must first convert that Local date/time to Zulu date/time, then enter the converted Zulu Date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once Personnel or Training updates have been imported via ARMS Web Services, these fields default to the Zulu date of the squadron's last successful Web Services import for that data type. You may change it to a date before the default but NOT after.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because ARMS gets a MILPDS update daily, Personnel records are updated in ARMS daily. Therefore all Personnel records will import with every Web Services Personnel and Training import.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ARMS Web Services does not provide the data necessary to determine the training event type (OTO, etc). For that reason PEX cannot guarantee the accuracy of the training events created during the import. For each inserted training event, the training event type can be verified in Continuation Training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can import data from multiple ARMS units (for example from a student squadron) into a single PEX squadron.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The import phase of the scheduled activity does not initiate until after the entire export has been received and acknowledged by ARMS, as the unit SARMs need to know that everything they sent from PEX was received and processed by ARMS before PEX begins taking an export from ARMS. This ensures that PEX and ARMS data for each person is always in synch/agreement. It's okay if the export is rejected or failed for a particular person, as the SARM gets a report in the PEX log listing which persons' exports failed. This allows the SARM to know why PEX shows one thing but ARMS shows another for an individual person.</p>

<p>Your personnel have an Assigned Mission Ready Status, for example CMR (Combat Mission Ready) or BMC (Basic Mission Capable). Based on their flight, simulator, and training task accomplishments, PEX will calculate an Effective Mission Ready Status. For example, a person’s assigned status may be CMR but due to a low sortie count, the effective status could be BM3. Once setup, the Effective Mission Ready Status is viewable on the Letter of X and the Go/No-Go pages in PEX.</p>

<p>SIM Required wil be selected by default. If SIMs are optional and could be used to count toward your Flight RAP, select SIM Optional, skip step 8, and continue at step 9. If SIMs are required, enter the total SIMs per training cycle, 3-Month Look back (SIMs) and 1-Month Look back (SIMs) per your RTM.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Required SIMs</p>
<p>Under the required SIM RAP requirement numbers, there are five possible rules that may apply to your unit. If a rule applies, check the box to the left of the rule and enter the value for that rule. If you select the TDY Proration rule, you wil enter the personnel TDY days on the RAP O&amp;M TDY page (described below). An explanation of each rule fol ows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Max number of excess RAP flights counted as SIMs for 1-month requirement. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP flights that can substitute for a RAP SIM, for the 1-month requirement.
    For example, a person has a one-month flight RAP requirement of 9 and a one-month SIM RAP requirement of 3. The rule is checked and a value of 1 flight has been entered. The person has accomplished 12 RAP flights and 1 RAP SIM. This person would not have met their one month SIM RAP requirements since only 1 actual RAP SIM was accomplished and only 1 of the excess 3 RAP flights could be counted as a SIM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max number of excess RAP flights counted as SIMs for 3-month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP flights that can substitute for a RAP SIM, for 3-month look back.
    For example, a person has the following flight/SIM RAP requirements: one-month flight 9, three-month flight 27, one-month SIM 3, and three-month SIM 9. The rule is checked and a value of 4 is entered. The person has 12 flights one month and 30 for 3 months. The person has 2 SIMs for one month and 7 SIMs for three months. In this case, the person did not meet one-month SIM RAP requirements, but did make the three-month requirement because two excess RAP counting flights could be substituted for the 2 RAP SIMs the person was short for three month SIM look back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max number of excess RAP SIMs that can be counted as flights for 1 month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP SIMs that can substitute for a RAP flight, for the 1-month requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max number of excess RAP SIMs that can be counted as flights for 3 month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP SIMs that can substitute for a RAP flight, for 3-month look back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimum actual SIMs required per month. The entered value indicates the number of actual RAP SIMs that must be accomplished in a month to retain status. If this rule is used in conjunction with either of the rules above or the TDY Proration rule below, it takes precedence.
    For example, the one-month rule and this rule have been selected with values of 3 and 1 respectively. The SIM RAP 1 month requirement is 3. The person has 3 excess RAP flights, but no RAP SIMs. This person would not make RAP requirements because they didn’t get at least 1 actual RAP SIM, even though they had enough excess RAP flights to otherwise meet the requirements for 1 month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TDY Proration. For each month: #X O&amp;M days TDY reduces the SIM requirement by #X for that month. This rule allows you to prorate RAP SIMs for O&amp;M days spent TDY. Proration can be down to 0, but the previous rule still takes precedence, so even if you prorate to 0, if you have a requirement to have at least 1 in a month and the person does not get it, they don’t meet the RAP requirement. The O&amp;M TDY days are entered for each individual on the RAP O&amp;M TDY page and are entered by month. For example, the rule is selected and the values indicate 3 O&amp;M TDY days reduce the SIM requirement by 1 for the month. SIM RAP requirement for the month is 3. The person had 5 days of O&amp;M TDY. The person also accomplished 1 RAP SIM. This person would not make their one-month requirement since the rule would credit them only 1 SIM. If the person had 6 O&amp;M TDY days, they would have made their one-month requirement since the rule would credit 2 RAP SIMs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Min number of SIMs required in one month to regain Msn Rdy Status. This rule is based on the person being in a non-mission ready status and needs to accomplish a set number of actual RAP SIMs to regain status, in addition to the look back numbers. This rule takes precedence over the one and three-month rules.
    For example, the rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. The one-month requirement is 3 RAP SIMs and 9 RAP flights. The person was non-mission ready. The one month rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. The person has accomplished 12 RAP flights and 1 RAP SIM. The person is still non-mission ready. Even though they met their flight RAP numbers and the first rule all ows them to meet their SIM RAP numbers, the person didn’t get the two actual RAP SIMs that were required to regain status.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>!!! Note
    Whenever you change these optional check boxes, click save to ensure your PEX is updated.</p>
<p>Optional SIMs</p>
<p>Under the optional SIM RAP requirement numbers, there are two possible rules that may apply to your unit. If a rule applies, check the box to the left of the rule and enter the value for that rule. An explanation of each rule follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Max number of SIMs per training cycle that can be counted as RAP Flight look back. This could be read as “How many of the first RAP SIMs in the training cycle can count towards using the rule below - counting RAP SIMs for flights by month.” In other words, once the person accomplishes this many RAP SIMs, no matter when in the training cycle, subsequent RAP SIMs can no longer count towards flights.</p>
<p>For example, this training cycle rule is checked with a value of 8. The monthly rule below is also checked with a value of RAP flight requirements are 9 flights per month and 27 flights for three-month look back.</p>
<p>First Month – The person gets 9 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. The person makes RAP with their flights alone. However, two RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum, even though they weren’t required to make RAP.</p>
<p>Second Month - The person gets 7 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. The person made RAP based on the combination of RAP flights and RAP SIMs. Whether they were used to make RAP or not, two more RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum. He is up to 4 of the 8.</p>
<p>Third Month - The person gets 6 RAP flights and 3 RAP SIMs. The person did not make RAP.</p>
<p>Even though they had a combination that equaled 9, because only 2 of the 3 RAP SIMs count using the rule below. Whether they were used to make RAP or not, three more RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum. He is up to 7 of the 8.</p>
<p>Fourth Month - The person gets 7 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. As soon as he did the first RAP</p>
<p>SIM this month, that hits the 8 maximum. The person did not make RAP. Even though the rule below says two SIMs could be used monthly, the training cycle rule takes precedence and only 1 SIM could count.</p>
<p>Subsequent Months – No more RAP SIMs could count towards the monthly requirement because the person already hit the 8 maximum.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is the person accomplishing all 8 RAP SIMs the first month of the training cycle and not using any towards RAP flights. Since the maximum of 8 were accomplished, no subsequent RAP SIMs in the entire training cycle could be used to count towards meeting future monthly RAP flight requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max number of SIMs per month that can be counted as RAP Flight look back. Enter the maximum number of RAP SIMs per month that can be counted toward flight RAP.</p>
<p>For example, the rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. Person is required 9 flights for one-month RAP requirement. The person accomplished 7 RAP flights and 3 RAP SIMs. The person would make their one-month flight RAP requirement because 2 of the SIMs would count toward the 2 flights the person was short.</p>

<p>Follow these steps when a guest shows up to work with your unit and you want their ARMS data to show up in your PEX database and/or you want to export their training data to ARMS. These steps do not apply for transferring AFTO 781 dat1.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE Obtain an ARMS External Account in order to access each ARMS database that stores data for a guest flier.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Log into PEX as an administrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to Setup &gt; Squadrons and add a “Guest Flier” squadron. Log out of PEX and log back in for changes to take effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to CT &gt; Setup &gt; Unit Cycle. In the Guest Flier squadron, create a Current training cycle to match your ARMS cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to CT &gt; ARMS &gt; Settings. In the Guest Flier squadron, associate the ARMS 9- and 17-character unit IDs with the Guest Flier squadron. The 9-character unit ID can be found in the flying hours .CSV file. The 17-character ID in the personnel .CSV file. Repeat this step for each different unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to CT &gt; ARMS &gt; Import, select the Guest Flier squadron. Select to import Personnel, Training, and Flying Hours. Click the Import button.</p>
</li>

<p>The ARMS tab is used to setup the PEX interface with ARMS, import ARMS tasks and export ARMS tasks.</p>
<p>ARMS 6.2 delivered a Jaspersoft reports interface. There are two interface functions that PEX - ARMs customers perform in PEX. Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Import data from ARMS to PEX</p>
<p>PEX no longer provides the Oracle Discover (.dis) files required to create the three .csv files. Instead, we wil generate Jaspersoft Ad Hoc Views/Reports. These Ad Hoc Views/Reports take the place of the .dis files. These Adhoc View/Reports will be in Jaspersoft and accessible to all ARMS users worldwide. Users will access these reports to generate the three.csv files: Personnel, Training, and 7-30-60-90 Personnel Flight Hours. Users must schedule the reports in ARMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Export data from PEX to ARMS</p>
<p>There is no change. Users still need to install the ODAC (Oracle Data Access Components) in order to push data out of PEX to ARMS.</p>

     Associating tasks to a MDS/CP impact the following areas/functions: Include in Check Assigned and the Training Go No-Go ball for No-Go tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type: The four types are Currency, Proficiency, Currency/Proficiency, or One-Time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currency tasks must be done at regular intervals defined by the task, e.g., once every 30 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proficiency tasks must be done a certain number of times within a training cycle, e.g., 10 times between 1 January 16 and 31 December 16. The No-Go checkbox is disabled for proficiency tasks because they do not have due dates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency/Proficiency tasks have a number that must be done by the end of the training cycle and also must be completed within periodic intervals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-Time tasks must be done once, ever.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency and Currency/Proficiency Tasks require a Frequency and Number, how often the task must be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Days: The task is due in a specified number of days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weekly. The task is due in a specified number of weeks, at the end of the week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Months: The task is due in a specified number of months, on the same numbered day it was accomplished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monthly: The task is due in a specified number of months, at the end of the month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quarterly: The task is due in a specified number of quarters, at the end of the quarter. Quarters are Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, and Oct- De3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semi-Annually: The task is due in a specified number of halves, at the end of the half. Halves are Jan-Jun and Jul-De3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Years: The task is due in a specified number of years, on the same date it was accomplished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annually (CY): The task is due in a specified number of years, at the end of the calendar year, 31 December.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annually (FY): The task is due in a specified number of years, at the end of the fiscal year, 30 September.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birth Month: The task is due annually on the last day of the birth month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training Cycle: The task is due by the end of the training cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freq #. Some frequency types (Days, Months, Monthly, Years, Annually (CY) and Annually (FY)) require you enter a number too. In other words, how many days, months, or years. E.g., a Years task with a Freq # of 5, means it must be done every five years. A task accomplished on 3 Jan 2016 would be due on 3 Jan 2021. A Weekly frequency requires a day of the week be specified and Birth Month all ows you to specify additional months beyond the Birth Month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prof #: The number of times the task must be accomplished during the training cycle. It is required only for Proficiency and Currency/Proficiency tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency Warning Days. Specifying warning days allows you to identify, by task, when you want tasks to be highlighted when they are approaching overdue status. Long warning wil highlight a task in Yellow. Short warning will highlight a task in Pink. E.g., you enter 30 days for Long warning and 5 days for short warning; when the task is within 30 days of going overdue, it will go yellow; when within 5 days, Pink. Tasks will always go red when actually overdue. Defaults to 60 days and 30 days respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program Code: Examples are PF, PT, et3. You can use unit program codes, similar to ARMS program codes, to filter unit tasks. You can assign multiple program codes to the same task. If the task is to be mapped to an ADLS task, it must have a program code of ADLS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active: Used to turn on the task. Inactive tasks wil be hidden throughout the rest of PEX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No-Go: No-Go is locally-determined. Marking a task as No-Go will turn a person's Training No-Go indicator red when the task is overdue. No-Go tasks are usually reserved for tasks that prevent a person from accomplishing duty, even with supervision, tasks such as Flight Physical or Altitude Chamber. No-Go tasks should not be dual categorized as Priority 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditing Required: When selected, the task will not update the person's training records until approved by the auditor. If not selected, as soon as the person reports accomplishment of the task, the task is considered done, without any supervisory auditing, and the person's training records are updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable Manual Override: When checked, these tasks can be reported (logged) from the Go/No-Go page by someone with appropriate supervisor permissions but will show as overwritten (“doughnut” indicator) until properly reported.</p>

<p>Temporary PEX/ARMS currency override.</p>
<p>Overview. The ARMS Bypass feature allows PEX users to ignore or bypass ARMS Training Task dates, on the occasion ARMS is down. With the bypass on, PEX will temporarily calculate training due dates within PEX.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Setting the Bypass to "On" will allow the unit to bypass ARMS currency and/or currency/proficiency type training events. It has no effect on proficiency and one-time tasks. Bypass means the unit will use PEX to manually calculate due dates for specific training events based off of a person's last recorded accomplished date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting the Bypass to "Off" with no ARMS training file import, means accomplished and due dates in PEX will not be updated until the next ARMS file import, even when logged and audited.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Training/Auditor ARMS and Squadron Administrator can turn this feature on or off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All other roles will be able to see banners throughout PEX in those areas where ARMS Training Events are displayed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>!!! CAUTION
    The Bypass feature is a back-up for the selected squadron when ARMS is down. It all ows users to overwrite Currency training event dates until ARMS is back online. Users must have source documents for overwriting dates. Bypass is turned off when an ARMS import is done and/or a user turns it off. ARMS is the true source for all training information; PEX is not a replacement system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set the ARMS Bypass to On.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to Training &gt; Continuation &gt; Setup &gt; ARMS Tasks &gt; Squadron.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Once the Bypass is turned on and the frequency days are set for the Training Tasks, an immediate calculation takes place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training Tasks that are marked Priority 1 or No-Go are also included if selected for bypass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any training events marked as "Manual Override" will not be considered for Bypass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reported Training Tasks must belong to the Current Training Cycle, audited and approved in PEX, in order for the Bypass to calculate the due date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bypass will use the latest approved last accomplished date to calculate a new last accomplished date and due date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bypass feature is turned "Off", when any ARMS .csv import is done in PEX (Personnel, Training, and or 7/30/60/90 day).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bypass feature can also be turned off, by simply setting the squadron's ARMS Bypass "Off".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frequency number of days to calculate Bypass due dates can be set from 0 to 2000 days. Training events set with a frequency of "0" are not calculated.</p>

<p>Reporting tab</p>
<p>There are several ways to report training accomplished in PEX. Below is a description of the different ways and recommendation on when to use each for reporting training accomplished.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flight Training from Squadron Daily Schedule: The best way for a person to report flight training is from the Squadron Daily Schedule page. The best practice is to setup this page in auto-refresh mode at Maintenance Debrief and/or the Ops Desk. In the Sortie grid, ensure the TAR column is selected for display. This will show a list of all the people on the sortie. When they get back from a flight, they click on their name, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight Training from My Page – TAR link: From My Page, in the top commitments section, the sortie will be listed, along with a TAR hyperlink. They can click on the TAR link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground Training (Scheduled) from My Page – TAR link: From My Page, in the top commitments section, the ground training will be listed, along with a TAR hyperlink. They can click on the TAR link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground Training (Unscheduled) from My Page – TAR (Non MSN) link: From My Page, in the top-right area, just below the TEST tab, click on the TAR (Non MSN) link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report Training for other people or multiple personnel at one time from CT Module – Reporting tab: Report training for multiple personnel where many of them logged the same tasks. You can report on one person, then use the Apply to all Remaining to copy the same accomplishments to the remaining crew members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a training task does not require auditing, when the Save/Next feature is used, the next record will appear not editable (it is automatically "approved" since no audit is required). If the next person needs to make a change from what was saved, a user with administrator permissions can right-click, and in the context menu select Unapprove &amp; Clear Accomplishment, and enter the required dat1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a group is reporting training using the Save/Next feature, and an individual needs to add a training task to their TAR right-click, and in the context menu select Additional Instance to add the required dat1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="report-by-person">Report by Person<a class="headerlink" href="#report-by-person" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the Person link at the top of the page.</p>
</li>

<p>Check the box next to at least one name from the Personnel grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Generate TAR. This will open a working copy of a report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the number of times you completed each task in the Accomplished Volume field and when the task was accomplished in the Date Accomplished fields. The accomplished date wil default to the current date when reporting by person but can be changed by clicking in the Date Accomplished field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on the worksheet, there may be additional activated columns for Time, Method, Scheduled Volume, Loss Reason, Score, Weapons Attempts and Weapons Hits. If these columns apply, enter the pertinent dat1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select to either Save/Next, Apply to all Remaining, Delete all , or Delete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To report the same task completed on more than one date: Enter the Accomplished Volume for the task, enter the date accomplished, right-click on the task and select Additional Instance. Enter the information for the task and click save. This feature adds another instance of the same task to the TAR with a different date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Save/Next button saves the current log entry. If you selected multiple people from the Personnel list, the Save/Next button takes you to the TAR for the next person in line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To report training tasks quickly when the number accomplished and date accomplished is the same for all personnel: select multiple people from the Personnel grid, update the accomplished volume and date for each task on the first TAR, and click Apply to All Remaining. This updates each TAR with the same accomplished volume and date for each task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you select Save/Next, if you input an event date outside of your training cycle or if the person was not assigned that task, PEX will generate a descriptive error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a task is assigned to a person that line of the report will be white (editable) for the Accomplished Volume and Accomplished Date blocks. If the task is not assigned to the individual, that line of the report will be a light gray (read only).</p>

<p>PEX uses the Last Completion date from the file to calculate the Task’s Due Date based upon the currency settings for the Task. For example, if the Task has a currency of 60 days and the file has a Last Completion date of 15 July 2017 then PEX wil calculate the person’s Due Date as 13 Sep 2017.</p>
<p>If using PEX to report and audit tasks, and the Accomplished Date reported/audited in PEX differs from that in the ADLS file, the Last Accomplished Date and Due Date in PEX will be overwritten during the import. That is because ADLS is considered the truth source for these tasks.</p>

<p>Qualification Training Overview</p>
<p>Qualification training topics are functionally divided between two modules. The topics covered under "Qualification Training" are common between Mission and OJT. Help topics for both Mission and OJT follow this overview.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Mission module covers initial and upgrade qualification training in the form of courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OJT module covers On-the-Job Training (OJT) in the form of Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) tasks lists, commonly referred to as AF Form 623a and 797 tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each module has a unique home page with their respective functions. Functions common to both Mission and OJT, such as Popular Topics and Overview Rainbow, appear on both home pages. Those links take the user to the same page, regardless of which home page was used. Links on each home page are arranged in a logical workflow order.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    The separate Mission and OJT modules are only in ePEX. WinPEX retains the legacy Qualification module.</p>
<p>Mission and OJT homepages are presented below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Functions common to both Mission and OJT are boxed in green.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New functions are boxed in orange.</p>

<p>Popular Topics are frequently asked questions about your students. Instead of figuring it out by yourself, PEX has automated many of your routine queries into this Popular Topics page. The questions are grouped by Courses, Task lists, and 623a entries. Once you have made your selections, the query will return any courses or task lists that have personnel assigned, if applicable.</p>
<p>For all categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hovering over the question will provide a brief description of the type of results each query will yield. Select the question you want answered and enter a value if required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data can be further refined by applying a personnel filter under Optional Filters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Load at the bottom of the Popular Topics dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results for applicable personnel will display on the right side of the screen. The data returned will differ by the question selected, but will always include the person’s name and squadron. Selecting a person’s name will open their Training Folder to the applicable tab with the correct Course or Task List selected.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Mission training module is used to manage upgrade training. This upgrade training can take the form of short in-unit upgrades and formal schoolhouse upgrades. Before you can utilize Mission training, you must configure several Setup features to your unit’s specifications. This includes adding Grade Sets, creating Training Tasks that wil be used for your courses, and setting the number of monthly and quarterly reviews for student’s Grade Folders.</p>
<p>Controls</p>
<p>Access this module by navigating to Main Menu &gt; Training &gt; Mission.</p>
<p>Workspace</p>
<p><img alt="binders" src="img/Training/Mission%20Overview.jpg" style="height:100%;width:100%" /></p>
<p>Setup Mission Training</p>
<p>Select the Setup Tab in the QT module.</p>
<p>Add a Grade Set</p>
<p>A grade set is all the different grades you will use when evaluating student tasks and Blocks of Instruction (BOI). Each MAJCOM uses different grades. A Grade Set is where you tell PEX which grades you are going to use.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training &gt; Mission &gt; Setup &gt; Course Grade Sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the squadron from the dropdown menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-Click in the Course Grade Sets Canvas and select Add.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Grade Set Name and click on the Canvas to save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide whether your MAJCOM/Unit utilizes: 1) Task Grades and BOI Grades or 2) Task Proficiency Levels, Task Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    All Grade Sets require BOI grades. You wil need to know this information in order to decide which Gradesheet form you should select when you are ready to create your course. Selecting the correct Gradesheet form that corresponds to your Grade Set will allow your grades to automatically populate to your chosen form once grading is complete. See Help Topic,  QT - Create Courses for selecting the appropriate Gradesheet forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add grades to the appropriate panel by right-clicking in the specific grid you would like to use. Assign grades/levels with the appropriate ranking (1 is the highest). It is imperative you assign the appropriate ranking to all grades/levels in order for the grading feature to work properly in PEX.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task Grade. These are the grades students can achieve on a specific task. This field is not required for all courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task Proficiency Level. Displays the grades student can achieve when they demonstrate/perform a specific task. This field is not required for all courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task Knowledge Level. Displays the grades student can achieve when they describe/explain a specific task. This field is not required for all courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BOI Grade. The grades students can achieve after completing a Block of Instruction. This field is required for all courses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the checkbox for the default grade/level for each panel, if desired. The default grade/level will automatically populate minimum grades for all BOIs and tasks built in the course. PEX will classify any grades above the minimum as satisfying requirements and any grade below the minimum as failing. If you would like to change the default minimum grade for specific BOIs or tasks, you can make this adjustment in the Course Build on the desired BOI(s) and task(s). See Help Topic, QT - Building Courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other options from this screen include the ability to send a Grade Set to another squadron (Send To), delete, print, and export Grades, Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels and/or BOI Grades to Excel by right-clicking a specific Grade Set.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>!!! NOTE
    Once a Grade Set is assigned to a course, you cannot make any revisions to that specific Grade Set. If you need to make revisions to a Grade Set that is being used, create a new Grade Set with a different name. Apply the new Grade Set to your desired course while you are on the Courses page. Delete the older/inaccurate Grade Set. Applying a new Grade Set for a course that has already been built will delete all minimum required Task Grades, Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades. You will need to input this information manually into the course BOIs. See Help Topics, QT - Create Courses.</p>
<h3 id="add-a-task-list">Add a Task List<a class="headerlink" href="#add-a-task-list" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Tasks are the graded items in a BOI. For example, a simulator training event would have numerous tasks, such as “Pre-mission Briefing.” This is where you enter all your tasks for all your courses.</p>
<p>Adding a master task list before beginning your course build will keep you from duplicating dat1. A master task list will also help you maintain standardization between courses.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training &gt; Mission &gt; Setup &gt; Course Tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the squadron from the dropdown menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Course Tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-Click in the Course Tasks Canvas and select Add.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the task a unique identifier for the Task Code. Using the same identifier with a different number for all the tasks listed in that course will allow you to easily search for Task Codes during course builds. Be sure to maintain consistency with your naming scheme. For example, “B-52 EW UPG-01” and “B-52 EW UPG-02”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other options available from this screen include the ability to send tasks to another squadron (Send To), delete a task, export tasks to Excel, and printing tasks by right-clicking on selected tasks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>!!! NOTE
    You can add additional tasks to your master task list. However, if a task has been applied to a course via a BOI, you cannot edit or delete this task from the master Task List until it has been removed from all BOIs.</p>
<h3 id="set-review-options">Set Review Options<a class="headerlink" href="#set-review-options" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Configuring Review Options allows you to select who can review/certify student folders and how often the reviews are required.</p>

    Before building a course, contact the PEX Help Desk. Often, we can build the course for you. If you want to build the course on your own, start with the help topic,  Create a Course.</p>
<p>After you have input your basic course information from the Help Topic, QT – Start Building a Course,</p>
<p>you may now finish building the details of your course.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Select the squadron from the dropdown menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Course Name from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    The course that you created will initially have the name of the course followed by (NEW). Once the BOI’s have been added and saved, that will change to (ACTIVE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Blocks of Instruction (BOI) to the correct training day by clicking the BOI icons and moving them to the appropriate spot on the course build canvas. Every distinct lesson is a BOI.</p>
<p>For example, ACAG 01 and ACAG 02 would be two different BOIs in PEX, even if the provided documentation has them blocked together on the same day. Do not identify pre-requisites yet.</p>
<p>You will identify pre-requisites at the very end of building the entire course. The order of multiple BOIs on the same training day is important, for readability. We recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Flight (at the top)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SIM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All others with a pre-req in or out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All stand-alone BOIs (no pre-req in or out)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the BOI Details by double-clicking on the icon or by right-clicking and selecting Edit Details. BOI Name is a mandatory field. Give the BOI a name. Name each BOI using capital letters, for readability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the BOI takes longer than one day to complete, change the # Days to the correct number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tasks are sub-components of the BOIs. While still in the BOI Details, add tasks by selecting the Tasks tab. Search from your master task file using either the Task Code or the   Task Name and select GO. Select the tasks you would like to use by moving them into the Tasks Canvas. If you do not have tasks in your master list, you can also add tasks by selecting Create New Task</p>
<p>in the BOI Details. Right-Click on the Create New Task Canvas and left click on the Create New Task. Be sure to give your tasks a unique identifier for the task code, but maintain consistency with the naming scheme for all tasks in the course.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    Information on building a mater task list is provided in the Help Topic, Mission Training Setup. If the BOI is only one thing, e.g., “BEEG 02 – Egress Lab”, it has no Task. Only the BOI is graded overall. If there is only a single graded item in the BOI, the BOI should not have any tasks at all. If a BOI has multiple things that need to be graded, then add a course task for each graded item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Type of task. This will help in creating a sound structure for your BOI.</p>
<p>Header. The header can be used as a divider between groupings of tasks within a single BOI. If this type of item is selected, the rest of the fields become “locked”.</p>
<p>Task. The actual task that you need to record.</p>
<p>Sub Task. Is any task that will be needed to complete an overall task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Minimum BOI grade, Number Required, Minimum Grade, Minimum Proficiency Level, and Minimum Knowledge Level, if applicable. To make building courses more efficient, the minimums are defaulted to the grade/level you selected in the Grade Set build, see Help Topic, Setup under Mission Training. If you would like to change only a select few minimum grades to a higher or lower level, you may do so in the Edit Details canvas.</p>
<p>Minimum BOI Grade. The grade students must achieve on a Block of Instruction.</p>
<p>Number Required. Indicates how many times a student must accomplish a specific task in that specific BOI.</p>
<p>Minimum Grade. Demonstrates the grade students must achieve on a specific task. This field is not required for all courses.</p>
<p>Minimum Proficiency Level. Displays the grade students must achieve when they demonstrate/perform a specific task. This field is not required for all courses.</p>
<p>Minimum Knowledge Level. Displays the grade students must achieve when they describe/explain a specific task. This field is not required for all courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add any remarks, if necessary. Select Save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat this process until all of your BOIs are incorporated into your course.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    If BOIs have the same tasks, you can copy a BOI to another day by right-clicking on the desired BOI and selecting copy. On another day within the Canvas, right-click and paste. Do not forget to change your BOI name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add prerequisites for BOIs and Tasks by double-clicking the BOI icon to open the BOI Details. Select the BOIs tab. Open the folders to view tasks, if necessary. Move the selected BOIs and/or tasks to the Prerequisites Canvas. Select Save when you are finished adding all BOI and/or Task prerequisites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Canvas, select Show Prerequisite Lines to ensure prerequisites are input correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review your course for any errors you may have overlooked during the build. An easy way to review your course material in an accessible format is by generating a Course Details Report. See Help Topic, Course Details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activate your course after you make any necessary revisions. Training &gt; Mission &gt; Overview &gt; Courses. Select Activate.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    Once you activate a course, you cannot make revisions to that course. To revise, you would need to create a new version of the course and edit the new version. Therefore, you should always review and validate the course before activation.</p>
<p>The next step</p>
<p>Once you have activated your course, you may begin enrolling students. See Help Topic,  Managing Courses.</p>
<p>!!! NOTE
    Testing your course may also help you check the functionality of your course build. Try enrolling a “fake” student to the activated course and follow the normal procedures for grading material and completing the course. Evaluate whether or not your build yields the results you would like to see.</p>

If the date differs from the planned date determined when the student was enrolled (with or without using a template) PEX wil ask you to Edit the BOI Dates, however, once the BOI is graded, the date is harder to revise. The BOI Date can be easily changed before or during the grading process, but once the BOI is graded, the date is harder to revise. Edit the BOI Date, if necessary. There are four options in editing the BOI Dates from the pop up window:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change only this BOI to the selected date and all other BOI’s following.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change this BOI to the selected day and leave all other BOI’s as is.</p>

<p>!!! NOTE
    If a BOI is listed as Failed (red), Passed (green), or Not Applicable (grey), you will not be able to edit the BOI date. If you need to change the date of a BOI after it has been graded and saved, you wil need to open the BOI Grade Sheet. Then, on the BOI Overall Grade, select the blank entry (null) and click Save. This minor change will convert this BOI to an In Progress (blue) state. Once In Progress again, you can reopen the BOI Grade Sheet and now edit the date as appropriate. You will also need to reinsert the BOI Overall Grade and select Save.</p>

<p>Due to changing requirements, Task Lists are periodically revised. It then becomes necessary to transcribe the accomplished tasks from the Old Version Task List to the New Version for the Trainees. This transcription can now be done in PEX. The transcription is a two-step process.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first step is to transcribe the Trainees in Qualification Training. This step can only be accomplished by Administrators and Training Administrators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second step is to validate the transcription.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Transcribe a task list</p>
<p>As an Administrator or Training Administrator, go to Qualification Training. Supervisor and Training Administrators must Validate the Transcription before the Trainee’s Training Folder before it will transcribe fully.</p>

<p>A dialog will appear telling you the Transcription is complete, but it still needs to be validated in the Training Folder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Validate a Transcription</p>
<p>Validating the transcription finalizes the process. This allows you to verify that all items selected for transcription are applied correctly and if not, to make the necessary changes or cancel the transcription by deleting the new Task List from the Training Folder.</p>

<p>As an Administrator, Training Administrator or Supervisor of the Trainee open the Training Folder and click on the 623 tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both the old and new versions of the Task List will appear in the training grid on the top left side of the folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select each version of the Task List and verify the correct data has been transcribed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both Task Lists are read only until the transcription is validated or the new Task List is deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have verified that all data is correct, select the new version of the Task List and click the Validate Transcription button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This completes the process by leaving the Old Version of the Task List in a read only state (exception: you can still add a Completed Date to the Task List) and making the New Version active for use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Old Version of the Task List can be deleted from the Training Folder once the validation is completed. We strongly recommend printing a hard copy of the Old Version of Task List before deletion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once validated, the transcription can only be reversed by deleting the new Task List in the Training Folder. If the new Task List is deleted, the previous one is reactivated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Transcription to the New Version of the Task List wil be documented in Additional documentation.</p>
