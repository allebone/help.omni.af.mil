<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
The FCIF (Flight Crew Information File) page is used to view the status of individuals' read file items. </p>
<p>Although the default title is FCIF, the page is used to track all read file items, not just ones for flight crew. The FCIF page is intended to be used by multiple people in common areas. For this reason each user must enter their PEX SID to review and sign off a read file. </p>
<p>For instructions on read file administration, see FCIF Admin.  </p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong><br />
Any user can access the page.</p>
<p><strong>Controls</strong><br />
Access these procedures by navigating to Ops &gt; FCIF. If the module title has been changed in FCIF</p>
<p>Admin, it will appear as that title, for example; IRF, PRF, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The mobile-friendly Go/No-Go board replaces the legacy Go/No-Go display.</p>
<p>The PEX Go/No-Go module implements a positive control system. The module allows units to customize and display a Go/No-Go board with personnel status, personnel who are current and qualified to perform their missions and personnel who are not current and qualified. The module tracks medical status (DNIF - Duty Not Including Flying), read file signoffs (FCIF - Flight Crew Information File), training tasks (TNG), exams (TEST), Stan Eval (S/E) evaluations, Mission Ready Status, "Z" events (FLY) and flying hour maximums (HRS). In addition, units can add customized statuses to suit local needs.</p>

<p><strong>Module Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The default column headers of DNIF and FCIF can be changed in their respective modules.</li>
<li>Personnel with multiple MDSs and/or Crew Positions may (depending on the filters used) appear more than once on the Board. For example, a person with MDS qualifications of both B-2A and T-38A may be current on all B-2A training tasks but overdue on a T-38A tasks. That person would be green on the B-2A row and yellow on the T-38A row.</li>

<p><strong>Setup Training Tasks to be No-Go or Priority 1, or to allow manual override</strong><br />
For overdue continuation training tasks to appear in Go/No-Go they must be configured in Continuation Training as either No-Go or Priority 1. Enabling manual override is also accomplished in Continuation Training. For more see Continuation Training.</p>
<p>!!! note "Note"
     A task can be set to both No-Go and Priority 1, but the red No-Go logic will override the Priority 1 logic. i.e., it wil be either red (overdue) or green (not overdue), but never yellow.</p>
<p><strong>Effective and Assigned Mission Ready Status</strong><br />
See <a href="">Effective and Assigned Mission Ready Status</a></p>
<p>Ensure the Personnel module has the following fields filled in: Each person’s correct MDS, CPs, Qual Status Codes, and Mission Ready Status.</p>
<p><strong>Aviation Service Code (ASC)</strong><br />
The Aviation Service Code (ASC) is an Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) term that defines the entitlement and flight status of an aircrew member. The code can be found on the crewmembers aeronautical orders (AOs). This code is a combination of two other codes, the crewmember’s Entitlement Status Code (ESC) plus the Flying Status Code (FSC). ASC = ESC + FSC.</p>
<p>Certain ASCs mark the person No-Go.</p>
<p>During the PEX import of ARMS training data, a Z-004 training task is generated by PEX, Z-004 HARM-ASC TERM DATE. Going beyond the ASC Termination Date will also mark the person as No-Go.</p>
<p><em>ASC’s that are No-Go</em> - The ones in the right FSC column (red).<br />

<h3 id="letter-of-x-basics">Letter of X Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#letter-of-x-basics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
The Letter of X (LoX), also known as the Letter of Certifications, tracks certifications by person.</p>
<p>Personnel can by organized into groupings by MDS, CP, etc. Certifications can be organized in unit-defined groups. LoX is database-wide using the visibility concept which allows certifications to be used by all units in the database, provided the certification is marked as visible to those units in the setup. The visibility concept makes it much easier to remove Certifications, Statuses, and Categories when not in use.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>PEX Administrator</em> and <em>LoX Administrator</em> - Add, manage, assign, unassign certifications and create templates and custom views.</li>
<li><em>Draft Approver</em> - If draft approver process is enabled, approve and disapprove certification changes.</li>
<li><em>Basic User</em> - View LoX using already created filters, custom views and templates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module Notes</strong><br />
Certifications are tied to specific MDS(s) and Crew Position(s).</p>
<p>!!! warning "Warning"
     Changing a LoX item will affect all squadrons with visibility to that item. For example, your database has the certification “Syrian AOR Threat” and visibility is selected for multiple squadrons. If you change the item to “Syrian Air Threat” it will appear as such in al squadrons, not just yours. This includes squadrons using the item to which you may not have permission. For more see [Miscellaneous &gt; Visibility Model].</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p><em>Qualification</em> - A qualification is the person’s reason for being in the squadron. It consists of an MDS and Crew Position. A person must have at least one primary qualification, but can have as many secondary qualifications as needed. A person’s qualification (or Qual) is established in Setup &gt; Personnel &gt; Quals Tab.</p>
<p><em>Certification</em> - A Certification is a basic capability that you want to assign to a select person or group of people for scheduling and/or tracking purposes.</p>
<p><em>Draft</em> - A change to a person’s certification. This only applies when the Squadron has chosen to “Enable Draft Process”. A change can be the first time a person is assigned the certification, a change to the person’s status, certification, decertification, recertification, and/or expiration dates, and any remarks associated to the certification.</p>
<p><em>Category</em> - Categories are optional. They are used to organize certifications.</p>
<p><em>Statuses</em> - The range of symbols you want to select from when assigning someone a certification (i.e., X, I, T). The status also includes a definition. The status and definition together makes the status unique, therefore, there can be a status of T – Training and T – In Training.</p>
<p><em>Assigned Mission Ready Status</em> - What the person is assigned in the Personnel module</p>
<p><em>Effective Mission Ready Status</em> - Status the person is currently performing at based on the requirements entered in the Continuation Training module.</p>
<p><em>Is Certified</em> - Each status has an "Is Certified" option. When checked, anyone with this status will be counted for the respective certification in the Long Range Schedule and will be eligible for display in the Mission Board, Schedule Supervisors dropdown. For example, a status of "T" (in training) would have <em>Is Certified</em> unchecked so trainees do not count towards shift requirements, nor would the person appear in the supervisor schedule dropdown.</p>
<p><em>Visibility</em> - An indication of whether a certification can be seen/used by a given unit.</p>
<p><em>LoX Template</em> - The template determines what certifications will be displayed and in what order. It will determine if selected dates will be displayed with the certifications. It contains signature block data and remarks.</p>
<p><em>Certification Date</em> - Optional field to indicate when an individual was certified.</p>
<p><em>Recertification Date</em> - Optional field to indicate when an individual is due for recertification (notionally).</p>
<p><em>Expiration Date</em> - Optional field that, when used (and is a date that is in the past) will cause the person to be Decertified (for expiration) in that certification.</p>
<p><em>Decertification Date</em> - Optional field that can be populated to indicate when a person was Decertified (for cause) in a given certification.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary Setup</strong></p>
<p>Before building a Letter of X, your squadrons must be established (Setup &gt; Squadrons), and populated with personnel (Setup &gt; Personnel). These personnel need to be assigned at least one qualification via the Personnel Module, Quals Tab. The key elements in a qualification are the MDS and Crew Position.</p>
<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
<p><em>Categories</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Setup &gt; Categories.</li>
<li>Click Add Category.</li>
<li>Enter the name, up to 25 characters, and save. Repeat as needed. For example, if you want to group your certifications under the headings Mission Qualifications and Non-Mission Qualifications, then create those two categories.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Status</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Setup &gt; Status.</li>
<li>Click Add Status.</li>
<li>Enter the name, up to 5 characters. Enter a Description, up to 30 Characters. Uncheck the Is Certified Box only if you don’t want people assigned this status to count against mission requirements. Save.</li>
<li>Repeat for the range of statuses you plan to use. Common use cases would by<strong>X</strong> (Qualified),<strong>I</strong> (Instructor),<strong>T</strong> (Training).</li>
</ol>
<p>!!! caution "Caution"
     Consult someone with database-wide LoX Admin permissions (or higher) before deleting a status from the list of statuses (LoX &gt; Setup &gt; Statuses). Anyone in the database using that status will lose it, even if they are in a different unit to which you do not have permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Certifications</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Setup &gt; Certifications</li>
<li>Click <code>Add Certification</code>.</li>
<li>Check at least one MDS and Crew Position.</li>
<li>Check at least one status.</li>
<li>Check the optional category (or categories) you want to associate this certification with.</li>
<li>Check the units that will use this certification (this is known as establishing visibility)</li>
<li>Click <code>Save</code></li>
</ol>
<p>!!! note "Note"
     You will be unable to uncheck an MDS or CP setting once the certification is saved. You will still be able to check additional MDS and Crew Position combinations for that certification, but never uncheck. If an expected MDS or CP is not listed, make sure someone is assigned to that MDS and CP in Setup &gt; Personnel Module &gt; Quals Tab.</p>
<p>!!! tip "Tip"
     Sometimes units carry certifications which are progressive and exclusive. These can be combined into a single certification with a unique status. For instance, 2-ship flight lead and 4-ship flight lead do not need to be tracked as separate certifications. The Certification could be Flight Lead and the status assigned could be 2F, 4F, and T.</p>
<p><em>Visibility</em></p>
<p>Make certifications visible to, or remove visibility from, squadrons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check or uncheck the box in the row of the certification and column of the squadron to add or remove visibility. </li>
<li>Click the save icon.</li>
</ol>
<p>!!! note "Note"
     You will not be able to add, edit, or delete a certification after you start modifying visibility until you click the save or undo icon.</p>
<p><em>Associate Training Tasks to Certification</em><br />
Associating certifications to training tasks will display the training task status (yellow or pink) from the continuation training module on the LoX display/report. Current training will not show any color coding on the LoX display/report.</p>
<p>!!! note "Note"
     When a person assigned a certification that has been associated to a training tasks, if the person is not assigned the assigned the associated training task or goes overdue for completion, then the certification status will be “DT” or Decertified for Training.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the certification and click Associate Training Tasks to Certification or right click on the certification and select Associate Training Tasks to Certification<ol>
<li>Select the squadron.</li>
<li>Select the MDS.</li>
<li>Check the radio box next to each task to be associated to the certification.</li>
<li>Click Save and Close or Save to keep the window open and select to associate another certification to training tasks.</li>
<li>Select Setup &gt; Draft Process.</li>

     * Personnel Draft Certifications impacts filters in other modules. If this is enabled, and a person has a draft certification, a filter requiring a particular certification will not return that person’s name, unless he had a previously approved certification. For example; you are filtering for a certification named “SOF with X status” and SmithJ had the certification as SOF with an X status. But now he’s assigned a draft that is SOF, E status. When filtering for SOF, X status, Smith J’s name will return. If filtering for SOF E status, Smith J’s name won’t return.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
The ORM (Operational Risk Management) module provides a tool for assessing the risk associated with conducting missions under different conditions. The module takes into consideration Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Crew Stress, and user-defined Risk Conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To access and configure ORM &gt; Setup tab: Administrator.</li>
<li>To accomplish Risk Analysis: Basic User, OPS Desk, OPS Staff, SOF, or Flight Scheduler.</li>
<li>To view the ORM module: Ground Scheduler or Flying Hours roles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the takeoff time is in the past, you cannot make changes to Risk Conditions or Crew Stress, and the Sortie Risk Value is preserved.</li>
<li>If more than one condition is selected within a category, PEX calculates the riskiest condition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Sorties grid displays sorties as setup in Scheduling &gt; Flying Schedule &gt; Crew tab. </li>
<li>Selecting a formation shows all formation crewmembers, even though each sortie is independently valued.</li>
<li>The ORM module has no functionality for printing a report or for managing supervisor approval of missions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controls</strong><br />
These procedures are accessed by navigating to Ops &gt; ORM.</p>
<p><strong>Setup Overview</strong><br />
First setup other PEX modules for ORM. Then setup the ORM module itself by establishing Risk Categories, and within each Category, assign Risk Conditions and Values. Determine the Approval Authority Levels for accumulated Risk Levels. Assign Risk Weighting Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Setup other PEX modules for ORM</strong><br />
Before using ORM, you must customize the data in other PEX modules according to your personnel and mission. Go to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup &gt; Validation &gt; Scheduling &gt; Mission Board &gt; Sortie Type Enter a Risk Value between 1 and 10 for each sortie type, 10 being the most risky sortie types.</li>
<li>Setup &gt; Personnel<ol>
<li>In each person's Pri Exp Risk column, enter a subjective risk between 1 and 10 for that person. Low experience equals higher risk. For example, an experienced person might have a value of 2, while an inexperienced person might have a value of 9.</li>
<li>In the Setup tab &gt; Crew Position, enter a subjective Risk Weighting percentage between 1 and 100 for each crew positions. The sum of your weightings for all crew positions must equal 100. For example, if you have single-seat fighters, enter 100. If you have a multi-crew mission, enter the percentage that each crew position impacts ORM. For example, Pilot = 75 and Copilot = 25.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Setup the ORM module</strong></p>
<p>Go to Ops &gt; ORM &gt; Setup tab.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Risk Categories</em> - Enter general categories of risk conditions. This list is completely unit-defined. Examples are Ceiling, Visibility, Icing, Precipitation, Crosswinds, and HQ Taskings.<ol>
<li>Right-click and select the required categories from the Master List.</li>
<li>Add it if it is not contained in the Master List.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>Risk Conditions</em> - The Risk Category column builds from the list of Risk Categories.<ol>
<li>Right-click and add a row.</li>
<li>Select the required Category.</li>
<li>Enter a Risk Condition.</li>
<li>Enter a Risk Value.</li>
<li>Repeat as required other Risk Conditions and Values within each Category. For example:  <blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Risk Category</th>
<th>Risk Condition</th>
<th>Risk Condition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Icing</td>
<td>Light</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Icing</td>
<td>Moderate</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Icing</td>
<td>Severe</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>Risk Levels</em> - This grid sets Approval Authority Level for accumulated risk values on each sortie.<ol>
<li>Right-click and add a row.</li>
<li>Enter a Max Risk Level value.</li>
<li>Enter a Description.</li>
<li>Enter a Color.</li>
<li>Enter the Approval Authority. For example:<blockquote>
<p><img alt="risk_level_example" src="img/Ops/risk_level_example.png" style="height:80%;width:80%" /></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Risk Weighting Settings.<ol>
<li><em>Risk Weightings</em> - Set the four relative factors, Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Pilot Stress, and Risk Conditions, to total 100. Your risk level totals need to be based on whether you use a risk graph display of raw or weighted as your total values are influenced by this option.  For example, if you have a Sortie Type risk value of 5, and a Personnel Experience Risk of 6, Risk Conditions of 4, and Crew Stress of 4, the Raw total is 19. In weighted Example 1 below, if you weighted each of those risk values at 25%, your Sortie Type risk value would be 1.25, Personnel Experience Risk 1.5, Risk Conditions 1.0, and Crew Stress of 1.0. Your total weighted risk is now 4.75. If you have a risk level of 5 or above requiring Squadron DO approval, the example would be above that threshold if using raw risk levels but would be below the threshold for weighted risk levels. Weighted example 2 sets the values at 10, 30, 40, and 20 percent.  <blockquote>
<p><img alt="orm_example" src="img/Ops/orm_example.png" style="height:80%;width:80%" /></p>

<li><em>Risk Graph Display</em> -This radio button selection sets the Sortie Risk display in the ORM tab to display either Raw or Weighted.</li>
<li>Save.</li>

<h3 id="weapons-loads-and-scls">Weapons Loads and SCLs<a class="headerlink" href="#weapons-loads-and-scls" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Weapons module is used to define Loads, MDS Stations, and SCLs (Standard Configuration Loads) for use in the flight scheduling module. The Weapons module can be used by transport-type squadrons to schedule cargo.</p>
<p><strong>Visibility</strong><br />
Use the Load Items Visibility and the SCLs Visibility pages to control which Load Items and SCLs show up in your squadron’s drop-down lists.</p>
<p><strong>Load Item Types</strong><br />
Load Item Types group similar load items. Examples of Load Item Types are Bombs, Pods, Chaff, and Flares. Right-click to Add, Delete, or Edit.</p>
<p><strong>Build a Load Item</strong><br />
Load Items represent the combination of different Components that produce a completed weapon.</p>
<p>For example, a MK-84 Load Item is comprised of a MK-84 Tail Fin component, MK-84 Main Weapon component, and MK-84 Nose Fuse component. You do not need to identify all components. For simplicity, you can pick just the main component, but every Load Item needs at least a single component.</p>
<p>Preparatory Steps (This will reduce clutter as you build a new Load Item):</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; Setup &gt; Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save.</li>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; Setup &gt; Components and de-select the checkboxes for Components not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save.</li>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; Setup &gt; Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>Building Steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; Load Item Builder and in the Load Item grid, right-click <code>Add</code>.</li>
<li>The Add Load Item dialog displays. At a minimum, select the Category, add a Code (e.g. A or 46), Name (e.g., AIM-9X), and select a Type. CRC, Weight, and Remarks can also be added but are not required.</li>
<li>Select from available components (left grid), by clicking and dragging it/them over to the Load Item Components Grid (right grid). When the desired component(s) is moved, select Save.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Edit a Load Item</strong><br />
Go to Munitions &gt; Load Item Builder. Right-click on the Load Item and select Edit.</p>
<p>To remove a component from the Load Item, right-click on the component and select Remove. If your Load Item is in use, you cannot edit the Category or Components. If you need to edit those, rename the Load Item to Load Item_old and re-build the correct Load Item from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Delete a Load Item</strong><br />
Normal y, you do not need to delete a Load Item. If you don’t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup &gt; Load Items Visibility. If you truly want to delete the Load Item from your database, de-select visibility on the Load Item from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete.</p>
<p><strong>Identify MDS Stations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create MDS configurations for assigned aircraft models. This is where you enter the stations on an MDS. Fighter examples are 1, 2, etc. Bomber examples are FWD Bomb Bay, AFT Bomb Bay.</li>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; Setup &gt; MDS Stations</li>
<li>Select the desired MDS</li>
<li>Right-click in the MDS Stations Grid and select <code>Add</code>.</li>
<li>Name the Station (e.g. 1 or FWD Bomb Bay).</li>
<li>In addition to listing every named MDS station, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares, if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them.</li>
<li>To edit or delete a Station, right-click on it. To adjust the order, click and drag the Station.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Build an SCL</strong><br />
SCLs represent the combination of different Load Items, by MDS, and by Station. For example, on a bomber MDS: 4 (Quantity) B-61 (Load Item) in the Forward Bomb Bay (Station) and 8 CBU-89 in the Aft Bomb Bay. This SCL could be called Standard Nuclear Load 1. A fighter example is: 1 AMRAAM on Station 1, 500 bundles of RR-112 Chaff on Station 3, and 1 AMRAAM on Station 5. This SCL could be called A5A.</p>
<p><em>Quick and Easy Way</em> – Use this method if all you need is a list of your SCLs to show up for scheduling and you don’t need any information in PEX about the SCL load items or which stations they are on. </p>
<p>Go to Munitions &gt; SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select <code>Add</code>. The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed (e.g. the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D). When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save.</p>
<p><em>Normal Way</em> – Use this method if you want the schedulers to know the load items in an SCL and which stations they go on.</p>
<p>Preparatory Steps (These will reduce the clutter as you build a new SCL and make the building steps easier):</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; Setup &gt; Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save.</li>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; Setup &gt; Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save.</li>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; Setup &gt; SCLs Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for SCLs not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>Building Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Munitions &gt; SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add.</li>
<li>The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. Description is not required, but is recommended. Example SCL names are SCL-01, A5A, Standard Conventional Load. An example SCL description is AIM-9X MAV MAV AIM-9X 500 Rounds.</li>
<li>In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D.</li>
<li>Click and drag the desired load items from the Available Load Items list to the desired Station.</li>
<li>To increase the quantity of a load item assigned to a station, double-click the Qty field and edit the number.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the SCL is ready for use, select the <code>Active</code> checkbox and <code>Save</code>.</p>
<p><em>Edit an SCL</em> - Right-click on the SCL and select <code>Edit</code>. To remove a Load Item from a Station, right-click on the Load Item and select Delete Load Item. To add a Load Item to a Station, drag it over from the Available Load Items grid. When done editing, click <code>Save</code>.</p>
<p><em>Delete an SCL</em> - Normally, you do not need to delete an SCL. If you don’t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup &gt; SCL Visibility. If you truly want to delete the SCL from your database, de-select visibility on the SCL from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. </p>
<p><em>Associate an SCL to a Sortie Type</em> - If a particular Sortie Type almost always uses the same SCL, PEX can default the SCL for you when you use the Mission Board. This does not work using the Flying Schedule Sortie Tab. Go to Setup &gt; Validation &gt; Mission Board &gt; Sortie Type and pick a default SCL for your Sortie Types.</p>
<p><strong>Use Automatic Load Codes (formerly known as Auto SCL)</strong><br />
Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which we in PEX call Load Code (formerly Auto SCL). For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. If your unit schedules load items this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use only a single station on the MDS/sortie. Call it whatever you like, “Sortie” would be fine.</li>
<li>Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them.</li>
<li>PEX will generate a Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board, once a Tail Number is selected.</li>

<h2 id="afto-form-781">AFTO Form 781<a class="headerlink" href="#afto-form-781" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
Use PEX to log AFTO 781 Mission Data and Aircrew Data. That data can then be audited within PEX and exported to the ARMS database.</p>
<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In Training &gt; Continuation &gt; ARMs &gt; Settings &gt; ARMS Data &gt; 781 Data: enter your unit’s HARM Code, 4-character Flying Organization Unit ID, 17-character Flying Organization Unit ID, and the Issuing Unit you want to appear on the AFTO 781. You can find this information on an existing 781.</li>
<li>In Maintenance &gt; Aircraft: enter the ARMS MDS and ARMS ID for each MDS and Tail Number.</li>
<li>Advise your flight schedulers they must enter the following information for each sortie: MDS, Tail #, Takeoff Location, Land Location, MUC (Mission Symbol) and Flight Authorization #.</li>
<li>Advise your crew schedulers to put the aircraft commander at the top of the crew list.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Implement</strong><br />
In the maintenance debrief office, setup a computer logged into PEX with the Squadron Daily Schedule (SDS) module in view. The SDS lists every sortie scheduled to fly that day. For each sortie, there is an “AFTO 781” link. When the crew gets back from flying, they would click on the 781 link for their sortie, fill out the Mission Data and Aircrew Data, and electronically sign off the pilot review. (They can also fill out their TAR.) The maintenance reviewer would then enter their initials and Save.</p>
<p>There are two alternatives to this process but neither way includes a good way to get the maintenance review into PEX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a computer near the Ops Desk for the crew to fill out their 781s and TARs.</li>
<li>When a crewmember logs into PEX, on My Page, for every sortie, there is a 781 link, near the TAR link, which brings up the electronic 781.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fil out the PEX AFTO 781</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on your sortie’s 781 link to launch the PEX AFTO 781 dialog.</li>
<li>If you flew on more than one sortie, in the same tail number, on the same day, PEX provides you the option to include those sorties on a single AFTO 781.  <blockquote>
<p>!!! note "Note" 
     ARMS uses only the Mission Number of the first flight in the sequence.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Fill out the Mission and Aircrew Data. Anyone can fill out the 781. <blockquote>
<p>!!! note "Note"
     You can use one of three different mission numbers. To pick, click Select next to Mission Number at the top of the 781 dialog. Choose either (PEX) Mission Number, AMC Mission Number, or Maintenance Line Number. This is a squadron-wide setting and will be retained for future 781s until changed again.
!!! note "Note"
     If the tail number (or MDS) changed at the last minute, you can click on the ARMS MDS or ARMS Serial # Edit links at the top of the dialog and update.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The Aircraft Commander signs off the Pilot Review using their PEX PIN (mandatory). This readies the 781 for SARM audit and export to ARMS. </li>
<li>The Maintenance Debriefer types in their initials and signs off their review (optional but recommended). Print out the 781 and leave the hard copy with Maintenance.</li>
