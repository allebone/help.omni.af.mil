<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
The Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) module provides your unit with a means to disseminate information quickly, usually of a temporary nature. The PEX FCIF Admin module implements the FCIF requirements of AFI11-202V2, and is easily adapted to similar types such as the Intelligence Read File (IRF). FCIFs are created and assigned in FCIF Admin by MDS and Crew Position. Users can read, and sign for, FCIFs from FCIF Overview, Go/No-Go, and My Page. Users sign for FCIFs with their PEX Security Identifier. Obsolete FCIFs are rescinded but remain in PEX as such and can be reactivated. After a suitable period FCIFs can be permanently deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>No-Go FCIFs</em> - Must be read and acknowledged prior to performing the mission. They appear red on Go/No-Go displays until signed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Non No-Go FCIFs</em> - Can be read and acknowledged at the user’s convenience. They appear yellow on Go/No-Go displays until signed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong><br />
Three permission roles can access the FCIF Admin module, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Stan Eval Administrator</em> and <em>Stan Eval Evaluator</em> can perform any function in FCIF Admin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Stan Eval Read Only</em> can view and print, but cannot add, rescind, delete or edit an FCIF. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sem-basics">SEM Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#sem-basics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
The Stan Eval Management (SEM) module enables you to administer a comprehensive Standardization and Evaluation program in accordance with Air Force Instructions. You can create, assign, grade, record and track evaluations. Configure PEX for your unit’s stan/eval program, tailored by Squadron, MDS and Crew Position. Exams are managed in Testing Admin and Testing. Evaluation reports are generated in Stan Eval Reports.</p>
<p>Further SEM guidance is in:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Stan Eval Setup</em> - How to configure PEX for your unit.</li>
<li><em>Stan Eval Overview</em> - How to manage your Stan Eval program.</li>
<li><em>Stan Eval Personnel</em> - How to use controls to navigate evaluations and related functions.</li>
<li><em>Stan Eval Tactics, Techniques and Procedures</em> - How to conduct various evaluations and related functions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong><br />
Three permission roles can access Management, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Stan Eval Administrator</em> - Can perform any function in SEM.</li>
<li><em>Stan Eval Examiner</em> - Is similar but cannot edit settings in Setup. Stan Eval Examiner can however, view, print and change displays in Setup.</li>
<li><em>Stan Eval Read Only</em> - Can print and change displays throughout SEM but cannot edit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Permission roles are assigned in Users &amp; Permissions. Examiners are selected in Preferences &gt; Eval Forms.</p>
<p>We suggest only persons with training in this module be given Stan Eval Administrator as some actions are difficult if not impossible to reverse. Stan Eval Read Only is intended for staff or HHQ inspectors who need only view data. Users not assigned a Stan Eval role can still view their own evaluation folder.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users cannot grade their own evaluations.</li>
<li>A grayed-out entry indicates it is in use and cannot be edited or deleted.</li>
<li>Entries with gray backgrounds are required by AFI, shipped with the software, and cannot be edited. Unit-added entries can be edited.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SEM pulls data from other PEX modules:</li>
<li><em>Maintenance &gt; Aircraft</em> - Verify the list the MDSs needed for Stan Eval. Some communities (e.g., aeromed) do not use the Series letter. By listing the MD and S characters separately you can control individual preferences in SEM. <a href="">Hyperlink</a></li>
<li><em>Setup &gt; Squadrons</em> - <a href="">Hyperlink</a><ul>
<li>Installation column, ensure your location is correct for your evaluation forms.</li>
<li>Display MDS in Dropdowns column, ensure your MDS(s) are checked for display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Setup &gt; Personnel &gt; Personnel</em> tab. <a href="">Hyperlink</a> <ul>
<li>Service Status column, identify each person as A - Active Duty, R - Reserve, or G -Guard. “A” is the default.</li>
<li>MDS and CP columns, ensure each person has the correct MDS and CP. If you need to assign or change data, go to the Quals tab. Each person must have at least one MDS/CP set as Primary. Additional MDS/CP combinations can be as added as required.  </li>
<li><em>Setup &gt; Users &amp; Permissions</em> <a href="">Hyperlink</a> Set permissions as desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evaluation folder import from another PEX database is included as part of personnel data file import in <em>Setup &gt; Personnel</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>!!! danger "Warning"
     PEX allows you to reopen closed evaluations. This deletes all signatures and revisions from the form. We recommend not reopening and closing evaluations completed in an earlier version of PEX as this can cause unanticipated results. For example, a person may appear to be qualified and current in all parts of SEM except for the Rainbow Unqualified panel list. Creating and deleting a SPOT eval on the person may resolve the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Workspace</strong></p>
<p>These features are accessed by navigating to Stan Eval &gt; Management.<br />
<img alt="se_management_workspace" src="img/StanEval/se_management_workspace.jpg" style="height:90%;width:90%" /></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Home</em> - Central display of all SEM pages.</li>
<li><em>Overview</em> - Stan Eval program management functions, overview of processes and timelines.</li>
<li><em>Personnel</em> - Administer evaluations.</li>
<li><em>Setup</em> - Configure how your squadron will execute Stan/Eval program.</li>
<li><em>Search and Pushpin</em> - Search for people by name. When “pinned” opens SEM to the pinned page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout SEM you have a choice of executing commands with either menu buttons or a right-click context menu. The following instructions are written around “best practices.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Save</em> - Most modules save data when clicking off a line but a few have Save buttons.</li>
<li><em>Expand/Collapse All</em> - Most SEM pages have a blue, expand-and-collapse-all-grids button at the center/top of the page grids.</li>
<li><em>User name</em> - The user names display throughout SEM are links to the person’s Person Details page.</li>
<li>SEM uses the “visibility” model to display options. Instead of adding multiple instances of the same item (e.g., a new eval type) to a database, a single instance of an item is added and made visible to the squadrons using it. This simplifies moving people between squadrons within a database. You must have SE permission to a squadron in order to view it in Setup.</li>
<li>When a person is added to your database from another PEX database via a Personnel Data File import, any Stan/Eval data will be automatically added. Likewise, if a person leaves your database for another, their Personnel Data File will include Stan/Eval data. </li>

<li>Show personnel with missing qualifications as Caution (Yellow Ball). In NoGo, persons with MDS/CP qualifications in <a href="">Setup &gt; Personnel &gt; Quals</a> and no corresponding qualification in SEM will display caution/yellow.<blockquote>
<p>!!! note "Note"
    If “Overdue or Failed evaluations place personnel in "NoGo state” is checked, “Show personnel with missing qualifications” switches from Caution (Yellow Ball) to NoGo state (Red Ball).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Show qualifications within 30 days of expiration as Caution (Yellow ball). In NoGo, persons with qualifications that expire within thirty days will show yellow. If on a wavier, NoGo uses the wavier expiration date.</li>
<li>Use the Failed Requisite Exam preference. Go/No-Go shows No-Go (red) or Caution (yellow), as selected with the radio buttons, for failed requisite exams. If unchecked, Go/No-Go shows green.<blockquote>
<p>!!! caution "Caution"
    PEX already identifies personnel as NoGo (red) if they have a failed a requisite CAPS/Boldface/EPE. If unchecked, there is no indication of failed requisite exams in Go/No-Go. The failed requisite exam does not need to be part of an open evaluation to change the Go/No-Go indicator. For personnel with multiple crew positions, PEX takes into account the MDS and crew position associated with the requisite exam. A successful re-take of the same Type (including MDS/CP) requisite exam will restore the Go/No-Go status to green.
!!! note "Note"
    Entering a passing or failed grade manually on an individual’s Eval Details &gt; Requisites will not affect the No-Go indicator. It the exam is taken on paper, enter it in PEX as an Offline Exam so it feeds No-Go.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Periodic Evaluation Expiration</em><br />
Enter the number of months for which an evaluation is valid. For a 17-month cycle, enter 18 (not 17). This determines the expiration date for this evaluation.</p>
<p><em>Eligibility Zone</em><br />
Enter the number of eligibility zone months for periodic evaluations. For aircrew and ISR units, enter 6.</p>
<p><em>Default Eval Form</em><br />
Select AF Form 8, 8a, 4350 or 4143. This will be the default for your squadron but can be changed on individual evaluations and on an individual’s Person Details. For aircrew, pick Form 8. For ISR units, pick Form 4350.</p>
<p><em>Eval Form Signature Mode</em><br />
Select whether you want to use digital (CAC) signatures or manual (pen-and-ink) signatures on the evaluation form. Digital is preferred.</p>
<p>!!! caution "Caution"
     When switching modes, any evaluation with some but not all signatures will dump those signatures. In other words, an evaluation form must have all digital or all manual signatures. This does not affect evals with all signatures in place.</p>
<p><em>Display MDS Series Letter</em>  <br />
For example, C-130H. Selecting <em>No</em> will display C-130, selecting <em>Yes</em> will display C-130H. For A2-directed ISR units, pick <em>No</em> unless you are in an F-15E unit.</p>
<p><em>Email Zone Notification Template and Email Late Requisites Template</em><br />
Edit the default emails sent when people enter their zone or are late on requisites. Use the buttons across the top to enter variables into the email. For ISR units, make the text edits which are directed in the PEX ISR SEM checklist Set up Preferences.</p>
<p><em>Additional Eval Reviews</em><br />
Setup a pre- and post- signature form review process. Whatever you enter here will be appended to the Additional Comments on the evaluation form. Pre-signature reviews, up to eight, must be completed before the examiner is allowed to digitally sign the form. The Posted review is activated after the examinee’s signature is on the form. In both cases a Review button activates when appropriate. Clicking Review registers the user account name of the person logged in. This cannot be a joint use account. For example, you are associated to multiple user accounts including yourself and PEXAdmin. If logged in as yourself you can sign off the review. If logged in as PEXAdmin you cannot.</p>

<p><strong>Assoc Eval Types/Reqs</strong><br />
This page associates eval types and requisites with individual MDS/CP combinations.</p>
<p>The combinations are universal throughout the database; squadrons listed in the navigation panel serve only to display and filter MDS and CP. Once configured in one squadron, that MDS/CP combination will show the same configuration in all squadrons. For example, you associate CV-22B pilots in squadron X to a QUAL with Open Book and Closed Book requisites. CV-22B pilots in squadrons Y and Z wil have the same QUAL/Open Book/Closed Book combination.</p>
<p>!!! caution "Caution"
     The above paragraph means that if you change the associations in your squadron, they will change for all other squadrons in your database with that MDS/CP.</p>

<p>If your MDS/CP file is not on the web site, contact the PEX Help Desk to have it built. </p>
<p>!!! note "Note"
     The older .xml files can still be imported but are being replaced by the current <code>.evalcrit</code> type.</p>
<p>Be aware that, if you import an older .xml format file with profiles, those profiles will import but cannot be edited or deleted. Applying new criteria from the Evaluation Criteria Tool tab will overwrite the old eval criteria, removing all existing profiles for that MDS/CP.</p>
<p>Each area, or subarea, has a name, sequence number and grading criteria. It may also have a Description and Notes. Areas/subareas marked as Critical can be graded “Q” or “U” but not “Q-.”Grading uses the standard AF Stan/Eval system. This is a guide; reference the applicable AFI for specifics.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Q</em> - Indicates the examinee demonstrated satisfactory knowledge and performance.</li>
<li><em>Q</em> - Indicates the examinee is qualified but requires debriefing or additional training.</li>

     * If a Q3 evaluation is corrected with a new RQ Recheck Flight or Task Phase evaluation, <strong>the eval type must be the same as the Q3 in order to reset the examinee’s qualification status.</strong> For example, if the Q3 type is SPOT, the recheck must be SPOT or the examinee wil continue to show as unqualified for SPOT.
     * If the Commander or SIO-Directed Downgrade has Ground or Knowledge Phase requisites, the RQ recheck will require completion of those requisites.
     * If the Commander or SIO-Directed Downgrade is of periodic type, the RQ recheck wil reset the examinee’s expiration date.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
The Testing Admin module allows you to create, assign, grade, record and track exams. Exams are created as proctored, non- proctored or practice. Proctored exams are assigned to examinees and require a proctor-designated user to permit the examinee access to the exam. Non-proctored exams are assigned to examinees and do not require a proctor. Practice exams are created and taken by any user without leaving a record. Trends can be assessed from proctored and non-proctored exams. Exams can be designated as requisites for Stan/Eval evaluations, or No-Go for periodic testing. Exams are taken in the Testing module. Testing reports are generated in Stan/Eval Reports.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong><br />
Two permission roles can access Testing Admin, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Testing Administrator can perform any function in Testing Admin and Testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing Evaluator is similar but cannot edit settings in Setup. Testing Evaluators can however, view, print and change displays in Setup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Permission roles are assigned in <em>Users &amp; Permissions</em>. Proctors are selected in <em>Setup</em>. They need not have Testing permissions but must have Basic User or higher in the examinee’s squadron.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users cannot proctor their own exams.</li>
<li>A grayed-out entry indicates it is in use and cannot be edited or deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>QDBs are Question Data Banks (a PEX term) that serve as containers for your exam questions.</li>
<li>It is not necessary to create identical exams in multiple squadrons. For example, create “CV-22A FE Open Book A” in squadron X. Assign the exam to people in squadron Z using the filters in Assign Exams. Neither the examinee nor proctor in squadron Z need have permissions to squadron X.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workspace</strong><br />
These procedures are accessed by navigating to Stan/Eval &gt; Testing Admin.</p>

      * <strong>Avoid Duplicates</strong> - Any subjects, references, and media in the imported QDB are displayed in the Subjects, References and Media columns. Compare the Imported Subjects to your Existing Subjects. If the imported Subject is the same as an existing Subject, with only a formatting difference, don’t add it as a new Subject. Instead, match it to an existing subject by selecting the existing subject in the field next to that imported subject. Do the same for the References and Media columns. For example, you have an existing reference of “AFI11-202V1” and the imported QDB contains “AFI 11-202 Vol 1 Training.” Both refer to the same document. If the two are not matched you wil have two instances of the same reference.

Each individual summary is based on one category and compiles data from the remaining categories. Each summary s category displays data, in columns, by criteria appropriate to that category. 
For example, using the categories listed above, a summary by the Grade category lists data from the remaining categories of Squadron, MDS, Eval Type, Crew Position, Eval Prefix, and Evaluator. Grades columns are Total, 1, 2 , and 3.</p>
<p>The sample report below shows an evaluation summary, by grade, for ten evaluations from two squadrons, each with one MDS and one crew position. I can see that, of those ten evals, two were initial (INIT) and five were no-notice (N/N), leaving three with no prefix. Further, of the five no-notice evaluations, which was 50% of the total, two, or 40%, were graded Q1 and three, or 60% were graded Q3.<br />
