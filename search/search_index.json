We can install pki certificates on your device that will allow you to access email and most sites that require a CAC. However, you are only able to access if you are to the BOCKSCAR network. Q: What do I do if my mobile device is involved in a classified message incident? \u00b6 A: Place the device into airplane mode. Contact us immediately. Do not power off the device, attempt to delete emails/files, or erase the device. !!! danger \"Warning\" Your device's email is synced with your email account.

This is helpful if you intend to use Apple Music, Apple News+, or Apple Podcasts. It is not required for any official function, and it will not give access to any additional applications not already approved for use. (See Below) Q: Where is the Apple App Store? \u00b6 A: Due to Security Requirements, all applications are carefully vetted through a series of channels and processes. To ensure this is done properly, we do not have an \"App Store,\" instead we have an \"App Catalog.\" All applications placed within have been extensively tested, documented, and approved. Additonally, it simplifies the question \"Can I use App ____?\" . If the app is in the App Catalog, it may be used. Q: How do I request an app to added to the App Catalog? \u00b6 A: You may begin the process by sending an email to: 55og.efb@us.af.mil . However, there is a considerable delay to this process, as we primarily focus on those apps necessary to accomplish our primary missions. Alternatively, you can search the current app vetting pipeline by navigating to the DISA Application Vetting Environment (DAVE) . Q: I forgot my device's passcode. I'm locked out! \u00b6 A: Visit our offices during customer service hours and we'll unlock your device. Be aware that unlocking the device may involve a reset of all you files/settings. Q: I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? \u00b6 A: Yes.

However, when you make highlights/notes in a file using GoodReader, it may ask if you want to \" ...create a seperate copy of the file, and save changes there... \" If you select create an annotated copy , GoodReader will create a copy of that file that contains your highlights/notes. The potential issue here is that when a new checklist or publication is released, a sync will overwrite your device's original file with the new version from the server...and the seperate, annotated copy you created will not be updated. The concern, from a Stan/Eval perspecive, is that the outdated copy will continue to be used or that duplicate copies could cause confusion. Ulimately, it is your responsibility to ensure current and complete publications are used while performing flying duties. Direct any questions, comments, or concerns to your squadron stan/eval section or OGV. Q: An iOS update is available for my device. Can I update? \u00b6 A: Yes.

GoodReader can automatically sync individual files and entire folders from their remote versions hosted on the BOCKSCAR server. In GoodReader, all files and folders that are a part of the sync process are tagged with a special badge: You can choose whether or not you want to keep modified local files. This option may preserve notes that you've put over a PDF file, even if the corresponding remote file was deleted or modified on the server (Use this feature with caution. Please see I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? in the Mobile FAQ). There are two different types of sync: normal sync and download-only. A normal sync is two-way. It keeps the contents of a local file or a folder identical to what you have on a server. During this process, GoodReader analyzes the contents of both local and remote folders and does the following: - Looks for modified files (for example, freshly annotated PDFs) on your device and uploads them to a server, replacing old ones there - Looks for modified files on a server and downloads them to your device, replacing old ones there - Looks for new files on a server and downloads them to your device - Looks for new local files and uploads them to a server - Looks for deleted files on a server that were previously present, and deletes them from your device. - Looks for deleted local files that were previously present, and deletes them from a server. A download-only sync is one-way, from the server to your device. It is a convenient distribution method for frequently-updated documents. This type of sync doesn't care what happens with your local files; It never puts anything on the server, never deletes anything from it, it only looks for new and modified remote files and downloads them as needed. When correctly configured, files that were deleted from the server will be deleted from your local device. The Aircrew Publications Library (APL) is a download-only sync. OGV maintains APL content on the BOCKSCAR server in a folder called 55_OG . Initial Setup \u00b6 For aircrew, this is usually done just before the device is issued to you. It only needs to be done once per each file/folder you wish to synchronize. All relevant remote files will be automatically downloaded to your device when doing the very first synchronization. Instructions for initial setup: Step 1: General App Settings \u00b6 First, set up general settings in GoodReader. Tap the Settings button on the main screen. Select the General Settings menu item. In General Settings , make the following changes: Turn off Use iCloud folder Turn off Use Downloads folder Make sure that Disable device auto-lock is on/enabled Step 2: Add the BOCKSCAR WebDAV server \u00b6 Next, add the BOCKSCAR server Tap the Connect button on the main screen.

Configure the new WebDAV Server as follows: Readable Title: BOCKSCAR URL-address: mdit-pubs.bockscar.mil Turn on/enable Windows-style name encoding Turn off Use cookies Leave all the other fields/settings unchanged Tap Add . You should now see BOCKSCAR listed as a saved server.

Resources Rainbow \u00b6 Introduction The Resources Rainbow displays Aircraft, Location, Mission, Personnel, and Squadron Commitments in a spreadsheet format. Basic User permissions are sufficient to view the Resources Rainbow. Permissions The permission roles allowed to create Resources Rainbow filters are Flight Scheduling, Ground Scheduling, Operations Desk, Operations Staff, Training Administrator, or Administrator. Setup the Resources Rainbow On each ePEX tab, click the Display Options icon to select the data you want to see. In WinPEX, click the icons. Committed Resources - Shows only scheduled resources All Resources - Shows unscheduled resources, in addition to scheduled resources. Availability - For people who entered Personnel Availability, their availability information is viewable on the Day and Week views. Availability does not show in the Month view. Use the Resources Rainbow The Resources Rainbow is used to see the schedule in order to make decisions. When there is only one commitment in a time cell, the number 1 is not shown so that the display is not cluttered with a bunch of ones. When there is more than one commitment within a time cell, the number of commitments is shown. To display details about the commitment(s), click on the commitment cell. The commitment(s) details will display in the Commitment Table. To clear the Commitment Table, click the Clear button. Aircraft Tab - Right-click on an aircraft commitment to Hot Link to Commitments Board \u2013 Aircraft (WinPEX only). Mission Tab - Right-click on a mission to Hot Link to Mission Board (WinPEX only). Personnel Tab - Right-click on a person commitment to Hot Link to Commitments Board - Personnel (WinPEX only). Background colors The colors indicate the Commitment Type; except for red, which indicates conflicting commitments. Multiple, non-overlapping, commitments are displayed in light blue. Click the Color Legend icon to see the definitions. The colors come from Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Commitments Board. Resources Rainbow differences between ePEX and WinPEX The main difference is filters cannot be created in ePEX. They can be used in ePEX but must be created in the WinPEX CV. Another slight difference is the placement of control icons. In WinPEX they are at upper-left. In ePEX they are at upper-right. Sortie Viewer \u00b6 Introduction The Sortie Viewer module allows you to design and then electronically display user-defined schedule data. The Full Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure IIS to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. On the Selection Tab, \u201ddrag and drop\u201d Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven (7) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. Before using data elements from the Mission Events (ME) or Sortie Events (SE) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label \u201dShow\u201d to the top box. From that point on (until you drag another ME or SE Label), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the \u201dShow\u201d event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events \u201dScheduled Date\u201d and \u201dScheduled Time.\u201d Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag \"Show\" more than once. After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the \"extra\" label. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the \u201dTail#\u201d data element from the Sorties list box. That way, PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag \"Tail#.\" Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag \"Status\" and \"Parking.\" After using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions (or 'Entire Crew') before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' !!! note \"Note\" * To increase the size allotted for a data element, \"drag and drop\" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, \"remarks\" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. * To display an air-refueling track name (e.g., AR101N), low-level route name (e.g., IR-644), a MOA name (e.g., Eglin 1), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the \u201dLocation\u201d for the appropriate Sortie Event (e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label (e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry) to the top grid followed by the \"Location\u201d data element. * Do not use empty fields. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Full Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. !!! note \"Note\" The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. !!! tip \"Tip\" In the header and footer areas, if you type in <br\\> it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says \"Additional Remarks\" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. Select your desired Full Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: On the IIS server Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. Click Apply. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. Give Everyone 'Full control' and Click OK. On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. On the client Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share In the Full Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server. As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. !!! note \"Note\" If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. !!! tip \"Tip\" The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or All Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout (Header and Footer Information) needs to be coordinated across the various units. Select View, Full Screen or click the Full Screen icon. To print the Full Screen View, right-click and select Print. To exit Ful Screen mode, press Esc. Sortie Viewer Menu File - Same as PEX Edit - Undo, Cut, Copy and Paste are non-functional this version. Clear Data \u2013 Removes all labels and data elements from the Selected Labels and Data Elements box. Also available as an icon on the menubar. View - Toolbar - Turns the Toolbar on and off.

The Full Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure IIS to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. On the Selection Tab, \u201ddrag and drop\u201d Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven (7) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. Before using data elements from the Mission Events (ME) or Sortie Events (SE) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label \u201dShow\u201d to the top box. From that point on (until you drag another ME or SE Label), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the \u201dShow\u201d event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events \u201dScheduled Date\u201d and \u201dScheduled Time.\u201d Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag \"Show\" more than once. After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the \"extra\" label. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the \u201dTail#\u201d data element from the Sorties list box. That way, PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag \"Tail#.\" Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag \"Status\" and \"Parking.\" After using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions (or 'Entire Crew') before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' !!! note \"Note\" * To increase the size allotted for a data element, \"drag and drop\" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, \"remarks\" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. * To display an air-refueling track name (e.g., AR101N), low-level route name (e.g., IR-644), a MOA name (e.g., Eglin 1), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the \u201dLocation\u201d for the appropriate Sortie Event (e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label (e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry) to the top grid followed by the \"Location\u201d data element. * Do not use empty fields. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Full Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. !!! note \"Note\" The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. !!! tip \"Tip\" In the header and footer areas, if you type in <br\\> it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says \"Additional Remarks\" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. Select your desired Full Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: On the IIS server Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. Click Apply. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. Give Everyone 'Full control' and Click OK. On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. On the client Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share In the Full Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server. As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. !!! note \"Note\" If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. !!! tip \"Tip\" The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or All Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout (Header and Footer Information) needs to be coordinated across the various units. Select View, Full Screen or click the Full Screen icon. To print the Full Screen View, right-click and select Print. To exit Ful Screen mode, press Esc.

The Status tab contains a status board to manage and display aircraft tail number statuses and discrepancies. You can use Aircraft to track other vehicles, such as trucks. The Setup tab configures the Maintenance module for your unit. Aircraft Generation: The Aircraft Generation module allows you to track the completion of al tasks that must be performed to generate aircraft for an operation. Reporting Reports: Reports provides maintenance a daily list of which load items (munitions, ammo, chaff, flares, etc.) installed on aircraft.

Tail Number is the serial number of a particular airplane, e.g., 99-0001. This module can also be used to track other equipment (vehicles, computers, etc.), besides aircraft, by simply changing some labels. MDSs are PEX database wide. They are not by squadron. Your squadron can pick which MDSs to see in the Squadrons module. The tail number list is MDS and squadron specific. Highlight an MDS, then use the squadron drop-down located between the aircraft and tail number grids. The tail number grid will populate with the tail numbers assigned to that squadron and MDS. Controls Aircraft and Setup. Access these procedures by navigating to Maintenance > Aircraft and the relevant tab. Status. Access these procedures by navigating to Maintenance > Aircraft > Status. The Status board opens in a new window. Workspace Aircraft \u00b6 Setup tab Introduction The Setup tab contains two sub-areas; the Settings and Lists used by your unit. Workspace Settings. Select your unit's settings. Lists. Manage which list items are used by your unit. Once created, list items are stored in the database Master List and associated to your unit. Squadron selector. View/Edit the Master List from the database. Associate a list item to your squadron if it exists, add it if it does not exist. Send Selected Items to other squadrons. This aids in standardization between similar units. Settings This allows the Maintenance Status board to automatically show an aircraft's status as Landed at a set number of minutes past its scheduled land time. Select your squadron. Use the rol er control to set the duration in minutes. Lists These items are displayed in other maintenance and scheduling modules. They can be created here or, if already in your database, pulled from the Master List. Once created, they are added to the Master List, and can be sent to other units in your database. REMIS MDS. PEX populates a list of MDSs from the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS). Check the MDSs you need to view in the Aircraft tab > REMIS MDS dropdown list. Configuration. Enter a set of aircraft configurations, i.e., all-cargo, distinguished visitor (DV), etc. It can also be used for simplified Standard Configuration Load (SCL) codes. Status Code. Enter/select aircraft maintenance status codes such as \"FMC\" (Fully Mission Capable). Select the appropriate color. Priority. Enter your unit's mission Priority codes. Symbol. Enter/select aircraft maintenance status symbols such as \"X\" (Major Discrepancy). You can also enter Rankings for each. Aircraft Parking Site. Enter your unit's aircraft parking spots. If desired, enter the elevation and Latitude/Longitude. Organization. Enter units not listed in your PEX Locations module. For example, your unit is in temporary possession of an aircraft owned by another unit. This is displayed in the Aircraft tab > Tail Number grid. Service. Enter/select Codes used by nonspecific groups of forces, such as AIR FORCES or COMBINED. Aircraft tab Introduction This tab lists aircraft resources for display in other PEX modules and allows interfaces with other programs. Aircraft are listed by Mission Design Series (MDS) and associates individual tail numbers to those MDSs. Tail numbers are listed by owning squadron, and can be associated to shared squadrons. MDSs and Tail Numbers can be matched to their REMIS, ARMS, and Emoc identifications. Workspace Aircraft MDS. Create aircraft MDS designations in your database. Once created in the database, each MDS is available to any squadron by selecting Show MDS in Dropdowns in the Setup >Squadrons module. Assigning tail numbers (below) to a squadron populates functionality in that squadron. Associate the MDS used in PEX to that used in ARMS, REMIS, and Emoc. Squadron dropdown selector. Select the squadron to which you want to assign a tail number. Tail Number. Create tail numbers in your database, in the owning squadron, and share them with other squadrons. In the example above, the 80 FS owns 80-2002, but 80-2002 can also be scheduled by the 35 FS. Associate the tail number used in PEX to that used in ARMS, REMIS, and Emoc. Designate owning and possessing organizations. Check which tail numbers to show in the assigned squadron's tail number dropdown list. Add an MDS In the MDS grid, right-click, select Add from the menu 370 In the MD column enter the aircraft\u2019s Mission and Design, e.g. C-130 In the S column and enter the Series e.g. J PEX wil combine these in the read-only MDS column, e.g. C-130J. !!! CAUTION Do not attempt to circumvent this process by entering the entire MDS in the MD box. Doing so will result in problems with the way MDSs are displayed in the various modules, forms, and reports in PEX. Match the PEX MDS to the ARMS MDS. The ARMS designation is used on the AFTO 781. !!! NOTE The CAMS MDS column is obsolete. Leave it blank. The remaining columns are optional; however, Speed and Fuel Flow are necessary to use the Distance-Time-Fuel feature of the Mission Board. Add a Tail Number Adding a tail number is required for full MDS functionality. Right-click and select Add Type in the tail number and select the squadron that owns it Select the squadrons that share it. This will allow other squadrons to schedule the tail number. Enter the ARMS ID so it shows up correctly on ARMS documents Enter data in the remaining columns as desired Show in Drop-Down. This column allows you to hide tail numbers throughout PEX. This prevents schedulers from accidentally scheduling an aircraft that\u2019s not available due to prolonged down time. Move a Tail Number to Another Squadron Pick the MDS Select the squadron that owns the tail number In the Tail Number grid, locate the tail number you want to move, and in the Squadron dropdown column, change the squadron to the gaining unit When the screen refreshes, the tail number wil disappear Change the squadron selector, just above the grid, to the gaining squadron, and you wil see the moved tail number. !!! CAUTION Do not attempt to circumvent this process by adding a slightly-modified version of the same tail number in a different squadron. For example, don't have tail number 99-0001 in Squadron A and tail number 001 in Squadron B, when both are real y the same thing. If you do this, later on when you want to see what tail number .. 01 is doing, you'll have to select it in multiple places and won't get an overall view, because PEX thinks they are two different airplanes. If more than one squadron needs to schedule the same tail number, instead of adding it separately to each squadron, share the tail number. Status tab Introduction The Status board opens in a new window and contains displays three grids. The three grids can be moved, sized and closed independently. Workspace Refresh. The board refreshes automatically every ten minutes. It can also be refreshed manually. The Last Refresh field displays date and time, in local or Zulu, and Julian Date. Mission Capable Rates. Mission Capable (MC), Fully Mission Capable (FMC), Partially Mission capable (PMC) and Not Mission Capable (NMC) rates are displayed as a percentage. Page controls. Labels allows for overwriting of existing column labels, or headers. For example, you can overwrite LOX with GOX. Page Settings allows you to show or hide grids and functions. It also contains the Aircraft Status Output Service generation function. Once the status board is configured, use Save Page Layout to save your display, or Restore Page Layout to return it to the original configuration. The Filter control is unique to maintenance and allows you to select one or more MDS, Squadron, Status, Actual Cfg and Actual SCL. Status board. Data display can be configured as required. Status and Discrepancies can be updated here or in the grids below. Status History. This grid can be configured and positioned independently of other the grids. Discrepancy List. This grid can be configured and positioned independently of other the grids. Status The Status grid displays data on individual aircraft. Some data feeds from other modules. Status and Discrepancy data is added and updated via hyperlink in the Status grid or in the grids described below. Status History This grid displays current and historical status/condition data. Right-click to add new status data. Click Edit to edit existing data. Discrepancy List This grid displays current and historical discrepancy data. Right-click to add new discrepancy data. Click Edit to edit existing data. This wil not change the status data; it must be updated separately. Aircraft Generation \u00b6 Aircraft Generation - Setup Introduction This module allows you to track the completion of all tasks that must be performed to generate aircraft for an operation. Permission Roles You need the Administrator role to setup the module. To monitor operations, you need the MX Scheduler role. The Ops Staff role can view the module. Setup Add tasks. Tasks are a list of events that need to be accomplished in order to generate aircraft. Examples of these would be \u201cFuel\u201d, \u201cWeapons Load\u201d, \u201cCrew Acceptance\u201d, etc. Click the Add Task button or right click for the functionality. When adding a task enter Name, Default Duration in HH+MM, and MDS. The task will be added as active and with your squadron selected as the squadron to \u201cShow In\u201d. If you want other squadrons to be able to use the tasks select those squadrons to \u201cShow In\u201d. Once the data is entered, you can either select \u201cSave\u201d to save the data and close the dialog or \u201cSave & New\u201d to add another task. You can Edit or Delete existing tasks by highlighting the task and selecting \u201cEdit Task\u201d or \u201cDelete Task\u201d from the toolbar action buttons or \u201cEdit \u201c or \u201cDelete\u201d from the right-click context menu. If a given squadron no longer uses a task, but other squadrons still need it, you can uncheck that squadron so they no longer see the task. In order to delete a Task, you must not have \u201cvisibility\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d selected for that Task. Build flows. Flows are a combination of Tasks grouped together to be accomplished in a logical sequence when generating an aircraft. Examples of these would be \u201cInstall tanks\u201d then \u201cfueling\u201d etc. Flows are added by selecting \u201cAdd Flow\u201d from the toolbar action buttons or \u201cAdd\u201d from the right-click context menu. When adding a flow, enter the Name. The Squadron dropdown filters the MDS list to be displayed. Once the MDS is selected, the available tasks for that MDS are populated in the left-hand grid. The Flow wil be added as active and with your squadron selected as the squadron to \u201cShow In\u201d. If you want other squadrons to be able to use the flow, select those squadrons to \u201cShow In\u201d. To include a Task on a flow, drag-n-drop a Task from the Available Tasks list to the right-hand grid. You can also use the Ctrl key to multi-select and drag multiple tasks at one time. Once the Tasks are added to the Flow, you can order them as applicable, again using drag-n-drop. Once they are in the order you desire, select the Calculate Start/End Times to complete the process. By doing this, you wil see the start time, end time, and duration for each Task. Once the data is entered, you can either select \u201cSave\u201d to save the data and close the dialog or \u201cSave & New\u201d to add another Flow. You can make changes or delete a flow by highlighting it and selecting \u201cEdit Flow\u201d or \u201cDelete Flow\u201d from the toolbar action buttons or \u201cEdit \u201c or \u201cDelete\u201d from the right-click context menu. You can add or remove flows from a squadron by checking/unchecking the appropriate box. In order to delete a Flow, you must not have \u201cvisibility\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d selected for that Flow. Build a template. A template is a combination of Flows plus a specific number of aircraft. The Flows within the template may be \u201cOffset\u201d from each other for a cascade start and also may be \u201cDelayed\u201d from the actual start of the Operation. Examples of templates would be \u201c12-Aircraft Red Flag\u201d and \u201c18-PAA Deploy\u201d etc. They can also be used for future exercises or operations. Templates are added by selecting \u201cAdd Template\u201d from the toolbar action buttons or \u201cAdd\u201d from the right-click context menu. The Template will be added as active and with your squadron selected as the squadron to \u201cShow In\u201d. If you want other squadrons to be able to use the template, select those squadrons to \u201cShow In\u201d. To include a Flow on a Template, drag-n-drop a Flow from the Available Flows list to the right-hand grid. If you are going to use multiple instances of a Flow on the Template, you can enter that number in the \u201c# of Lines\u201d and that number wil be added when you drag-n-drop that Flow. You can also use the Ctrl key to multi-select and drag multiple tasks at one time. Once the Flows are added to the Template, you can order them as applicable, again using drag-n-drop. Once they are in the order you desire, you can apply an Offset and/or Delay to the flows. To apply an Offset and/or Delay, enter the desired Offset and/or Delay in the right-hand grid and using the Shift or Ctrl keys, select the Flows that you want them applied to. You can hover over the \u201cApply Offset/Delay\u201d to see what will be applied in bold. If the Offset/Delay is correct select \u201cApply Offset/Delay\u201d to apply. Once the data is entered, you can either select \u201cSave\u201d to save the data and close the dialog or \u201cSave & New\u201d to add another Flow. You can edit or delete a template by highlighting it and selecting \u201cEdit Template\u201d or \u201cDelete Template\u201d from the toolbar action buttons or \u201cEdit \u201cor \u201cDelete\u201d from the right-click context menu. In order to delete a template you must not have \u201cvisibility\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d selected for that template. Aircraft Generation Introduction This module al ows you to track the completion of al tasks that must be performed to generate aircraft for an operation. Permission Roles You need the Administrator role to setup the module. To monitor operations, you need the MX Scheduler role. The Ops Staff role can view the module. Usage When an operation starts that needs aircraft generation, go to the Operations tab and select Add Operation from the toolbar. Enter the Name, Start or End Time, and Squadron of the Operation. Select the Template you want to use. If it does not exist, please refer to the Setup help topic that explains how to add a template. The Operation timing will be calculated based on whether you selected Start time or End time. If you enter Start time, times wil start at the time you designated and run for the duration of the Operation. If you selected End time, the calculation wil show you when you need to start your Operation in order to finish when desired. Monitor the Operation by selecting the Operation Details toolbar the More Options (...) button. This wil open the Details page, which can be moved to another monitor and left open. Additionally, you can set the refresh rate for this page. On the Details page, you can see the complete Operation. Add the tail# for each line using the dropdown. If there is an aircraft status in PEX it will be displayed in the Status column. To track the Operation, enter the actual start and end times by clicking in the appropriate box and entering the time. If the actual time is on or before scheduled, the box wil highlight green. If the time entered is after the scheduled time, the box wil highlight red. If the Scheduled time of the task passes with no Actual time having been entered, the Actual time field will turn yellow to help highlight the missing data. You can edit the Operation by selecting the Edit Operation button in the upper left-hand corner. This allows you to edit the Name and Time of the Operation. You can choose to shift all times in the Operation at this point. Additionally, you can Add, Edit, or Delete Flows from the Operation using the toolbar More Options (...) button.

Each MDS should be entered individual y in the MDS grid, e.g., F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. Also, for exporting AFTO 781 data, the ARMS MDS, e.g., F016A, for each should be identified in this grid. Maintenance, Aircraft, Tail Numbers. Each Tail Number should be assigned to its associated MDS, e.g., the F-16A Tail Numbers should be assigned to the F-16A and so forth. Also, for exporting AFTO 781 data, the ARMS ID for the tail number should be identified in this grid. Setup, Personnel, Qualifications. If a person is qualified to fly in more than one MDS, each MDS should be identified in the Quals & Certs tab > MDS/CP Qualification grid. For example, if the person is an instructor pilot that can fly all four models of F-16, that person should be assigned MDS Qualifications of F-16A IP, F-16B IP, F-16C IP, and F-16D IP. The model that is most frequently flown should be marked as the \u201cPrimary\u201d MDS/CP qualification. Setup, Personnel, Certifications. Pick one of the similar MDSs and enter all the certifications there, e.g., enter al F-16 certifications under \u201cF-16C\u201d. As a technique, to indicate a person is also certified in other F-16 models, you could create an \u201cF-16C\u201d certification called \u201cF-16A\u201d, another called \u201cF-16B\u201d, and another called \u201cF-16D\u201d. Scheduling, Flying Schedule, Sortie MDS. In the Sorties grid, in the MDS column, the desired MDS for the sortie should be identified. Once a Tail Number for the sortie is established, the true MDS should be updated, if required. Stan Eval, Testing, QDBs and Exams. If the QDB/Exam pertains to multiple MDSs, associate the QDB/Exam to all applicable MDSs simultaneously. For example, if a QDB/Exam applies to all types of F-16, associate it to F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. Stan Eval, Management, Setup, Assoc Eval Types & Reqs. Select the first MDS, e.g., F-16A, and enter the Eval Types and Requisites for it. Do the same for the other MDSs, e.g., F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. Normally, the Eval Types and Requisites will match for each MDS. Stan Eval, Management, Qualifications. Add a qualification for each MDS the person is authorized to fly. For example, if an Instrument evaluation in the F-16C also qualifies the person for Instrument in the other F-16s, enter an Instrument qualification in all four, i.e., F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. Each qualification should have the same \u201cLast Evaluation\u201d date. Stan Eval, Management, Open Evaluations. When adding an Open Evaluation, make sure to identify which MDS(s) also get updated as a result of the primary evaluation. For example, the Instrument evaluation may be conducted in the F-16D and it \u201cAlso Updates\u201d the F-16A, F-16B, and F-16C. Stan Eval, FCIF Admin. If the read file item pertains to multiple MDSs, associate the read file item to all applicable MDSs simultaneously. For example, if an item applies to all types of F-16, associate it to F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. Ops, Go/No-Go. If the above procedures are fol owed, the Go/No-Go page will display the correct data for Testing, FCIF, and Stan Eval, whether the page is filtered by MDS/CP, Msn/Sortie, or by Shift. AFTO 781. If the above procedures are followed, the AFTO 781 data will export correctly to the ARMS database. Maintenance Reports \u00b6 Daily MX Loads Introduction This report provides maintenance a daily list of which load items (munitions, ammo, chaff, flares, etc.) to install on the aircraft. The report is found at Maintenance> Reports> Daily MX Loads. Permission Roles To view/print this report, you need Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff permission role. Before using the report To get data to show up in the ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, OTHER, AMMO, CHAFF, or FLARES columns, you first must have Load Item Types of ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, Other, Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares in the Weapons > Munitions > Setup list. Then, specific Load Items must be categorized as one of those as the Load Item Types. Finally, schedule that particular Load Item onto a sortie station using the Flying Schedule> Loads tab. The report works best when Load Items are entered as Code numbers and names. The Load Item Name would be the plain text definition, e.g., Code = 46 and Name = Mk-82 Hi Drag. To minimize confusion, we recommend using distinct load item Codes/Names even across different types of load items. For example, don\u2019 t have load item code \"42\u201d which is an AIM-9 missile and another load item code \"42\u201d which is a travel pod. However, if you do use the same load item code/name across different types, the bottom legend will list which specific load item goes on which line number. Run the report Pick whether you want the report ordered with formations together or just strictly by MX Line #. Spare aircraft (any line number which includes the letters \"SP\u201d) are listed at the bottom. Pick whether you want the report to list al stations for the MDS or just the ones that have something on them (Populated Stations). Although Populated Stations shortens the report greatly, some people become confused when they don\u2019t see al the stations listed (the empty ones), so you have an option. Pick the date range of interest and whether you want times in Local or Zulu. Pick whether you want the Load Item Code shown vertically (for long ones) or horizontally (for short ones). Pick the Squadron(s), MDS(s), and Munition Project Number(s) of interest. Pick the columns of interest. If you select for display the following columns: ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, or OTHER; the load items of those types wil appear under those columns and not under a station. If you want those types of load items to appear under the station, do not select the ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, or OTHER columns for display. Click PDF or Excel to generate the report. !!! NOTE Depending on your Excel trust center settings, on the Windows File Download dialog you may need to Save the report first instead of Opening it directly. Weekly Frag Request Introduction This report is provided by Ops to munitions personnel to specify how many of each load item are scheduled by day, for five days. The report is found at Maintenance > Reports > Weekly Frag Request. Permission Roles To view/print this report the user needs Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff role. Before using the report CRC: Complete Round Codes (CRC) are entered in the Weapons module by editing the individual Load Item. This is a one-time setup step. Setting: Settings are entered in the Flying Schedule module on each sortie Station. When you enter station Settings, those settings will appear for every Load Item on that Station on the Weekly Frag Request. Settings are normal y fuse settings. Mount: To setup mounts and/or pylons, enter \u201cMount\u201d (case sensitive) as a Load Item Type. Then add your specific mounts and/or pylons as Load Items, making sure to select \u201cMount\u201d as the Load Item Type. This is a one-time setup step. To schedule mounts and/or pylons, add the mount/pylon as a normal load item to a station. Then, onto the same station, schedule other load items that wil be attached to the mount/pylon. On the Frag Report, each load item will now list the mount/pylon \u201cDescription\u201d (not Name) in the Mount column of the report. Run the report Pick the start date of the five-day range and whether you want times in Local or Zulu. Pick the MDSs, Munition Project Numbers, Categories, and Load Item Types of interest. Select PDF or Excel to generate the report. !!! NOTE Depending on your Excel trust center settings, you may need to \"Save\" the report first, as the \u201cOpen\" option may be blocked our will generate an Excel error message. Munitions grouping The report groups load items by Squadron, Munition Project Number, and MDS. Quantity (Qty) and Spare (Sp) calculations The Qty column shows the number of that particular load item scheduled for that day on primary aircraft. The Sp column shows the number of that particular load item scheduled for that day on spare aircraft (line numbers which include \"Sp.\"). The TOTAL column at the end shows the total of that particular load item scheduled for that week on primary aircraft plus the last (not total) Spare quantity for the week. In other words, the TOTAL column does not add up al the Sp for the week but uses the last daily value. AF 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination Introduction The PEX AF Form 2407 documents mission changes. Permission Roles To view/print this form the user needs Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff role. Setup You must use the Mission Board to Commit (firm) missions. From then on, when changes are made to squadron-specified fields on a committed mission, PEX allows you to enter information about why the change was made. This change information wil show up on the 2407. Generate the form Navigate to Maintenance > Reports > AF 2407 tab. Select your desired squadron and the schedule changes you want on the form.

Use the rol er control to set the duration in minutes. Lists These items are displayed in other maintenance and scheduling modules. They can be created here or, if already in your database, pulled from the Master List. Once created, they are added to the Master List, and can be sent to other units in your database. REMIS MDS. PEX populates a list of MDSs from the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS). Check the MDSs you need to view in the Aircraft tab > REMIS MDS dropdown list. Configuration. Enter a set of aircraft configurations, i.e., all-cargo, distinguished visitor (DV), etc. It can also be used for simplified Standard Configuration Load (SCL) codes. Status Code. Enter/select aircraft maintenance status codes such as \"FMC\" (Fully Mission Capable). Select the appropriate color. Priority. Enter your unit's mission Priority codes. Symbol. Enter/select aircraft maintenance status symbols such as \"X\" (Major Discrepancy). You can also enter Rankings for each. Aircraft Parking Site. Enter your unit's aircraft parking spots. If desired, enter the elevation and Latitude/Longitude. Organization. Enter units not listed in your PEX Locations module. For example, your unit is in temporary possession of an aircraft owned by another unit. This is displayed in the Aircraft tab > Tail Number grid. Service. Enter/select Codes used by nonspecific groups of forces, such as AIR FORCES or COMBINED. Aircraft tab Introduction This tab lists aircraft resources for display in other PEX modules and allows interfaces with other programs. Aircraft are listed by Mission Design Series (MDS) and associates individual tail numbers to those MDSs. Tail numbers are listed by owning squadron, and can be associated to shared squadrons. MDSs and Tail Numbers can be matched to their REMIS, ARMS, and Emoc identifications. Workspace Aircraft MDS. Create aircraft MDS designations in your database. Once created in the database, each MDS is available to any squadron by selecting Show MDS in Dropdowns in the Setup >Squadrons module. Assigning tail numbers (below) to a squadron populates functionality in that squadron. Associate the MDS used in PEX to that used in ARMS, REMIS, and Emoc. Squadron dropdown selector. Select the squadron to which you want to assign a tail number. Tail Number. Create tail numbers in your database, in the owning squadron, and share them with other squadrons. In the example above, the 80 FS owns 80-2002, but 80-2002 can also be scheduled by the 35 FS. Associate the tail number used in PEX to that used in ARMS, REMIS, and Emoc. Designate owning and possessing organizations. Check which tail numbers to show in the assigned squadron's tail number dropdown list. Add an MDS In the MDS grid, right-click, select Add from the menu 370 In the MD column enter the aircraft\u2019s Mission and Design, e.g. C-130 In the S column and enter the Series e.g. J PEX wil combine these in the read-only MDS column, e.g. C-130J. !!! CAUTION Do not attempt to circumvent this process by entering the entire MDS in the MD box. Doing so will result in problems with the way MDSs are displayed in the various modules, forms, and reports in PEX. Match the PEX MDS to the ARMS MDS. The ARMS designation is used on the AFTO 781. !!! NOTE The CAMS MDS column is obsolete. Leave it blank. The remaining columns are optional; however, Speed and Fuel Flow are necessary to use the Distance-Time-Fuel feature of the Mission Board. Add a Tail Number Adding a tail number is required for full MDS functionality. Right-click and select Add Type in the tail number and select the squadron that owns it Select the squadrons that share it. This will allow other squadrons to schedule the tail number. Enter the ARMS ID so it shows up correctly on ARMS documents Enter data in the remaining columns as desired Show in Drop-Down. This column allows you to hide tail numbers throughout PEX. This prevents schedulers from accidentally scheduling an aircraft that\u2019s not available due to prolonged down time. Move a Tail Number to Another Squadron Pick the MDS Select the squadron that owns the tail number In the Tail Number grid, locate the tail number you want to move, and in the Squadron dropdown column, change the squadron to the gaining unit When the screen refreshes, the tail number wil disappear Change the squadron selector, just above the grid, to the gaining squadron, and you wil see the moved tail number. !!! CAUTION Do not attempt to circumvent this process by adding a slightly-modified version of the same tail number in a different squadron. For example, don't have tail number 99-0001 in Squadron A and tail number 001 in Squadron B, when both are real y the same thing. If you do this, later on when you want to see what tail number .. 01 is doing, you'll have to select it in multiple places and won't get an overall view, because PEX thinks they are two different airplanes. If more than one squadron needs to schedule the same tail number, instead of adding it separately to each squadron, share the tail number. Status tab Introduction The Status board opens in a new window and contains displays three grids. The three grids can be moved, sized and closed independently. Workspace Refresh. The board refreshes automatically every ten minutes. It can also be refreshed manually. The Last Refresh field displays date and time, in local or Zulu, and Julian Date. Mission Capable Rates. Mission Capable (MC), Fully Mission Capable (FMC), Partially Mission capable (PMC) and Not Mission Capable (NMC) rates are displayed as a percentage. Page controls. Labels allows for overwriting of existing column labels, or headers. For example, you can overwrite LOX with GOX. Page Settings allows you to show or hide grids and functions. It also contains the Aircraft Status Output Service generation function.

The report is found at Maintenance> Reports> Daily MX Loads. Permission Roles To view/print this report, you need Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff permission role. Before using the report To get data to show up in the ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, OTHER, AMMO, CHAFF, or FLARES columns, you first must have Load Item Types of ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, Other, Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares in the Weapons > Munitions > Setup list. Then, specific Load Items must be categorized as one of those as the Load Item Types. Finally, schedule that particular Load Item onto a sortie station using the Flying Schedule> Loads tab. The report works best when Load Items are entered as Code numbers and names. The Load Item Name would be the plain text definition, e.g., Code = 46 and Name = Mk-82 Hi Drag. To minimize confusion, we recommend using distinct load item Codes/Names even across different types of load items. For example, don\u2019 t have load item code \"42\u201d which is an AIM-9 missile and another load item code \"42\u201d which is a travel pod. However, if you do use the same load item code/name across different types, the bottom legend will list which specific load item goes on which line number. Run the report Pick whether you want the report ordered with formations together or just strictly by MX Line #. Spare aircraft (any line number which includes the letters \"SP\u201d) are listed at the bottom. Pick whether you want the report to list al stations for the MDS or just the ones that have something on them (Populated Stations). Although Populated Stations shortens the report greatly, some people become confused when they don\u2019t see al the stations listed (the empty ones), so you have an option. Pick the date range of interest and whether you want times in Local or Zulu. Pick whether you want the Load Item Code shown vertically (for long ones) or horizontally (for short ones). Pick the Squadron(s), MDS(s), and Munition Project Number(s) of interest. Pick the columns of interest. If you select for display the following columns: ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, or OTHER; the load items of those types wil appear under those columns and not under a station. If you want those types of load items to appear under the station, do not select the ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, or OTHER columns for display. Click PDF or Excel to generate the report. !!! NOTE Depending on your Excel trust center settings, on the Windows File Download dialog you may need to Save the report first instead of Opening it directly. Weekly Frag Request Introduction This report is provided by Ops to munitions personnel to specify how many of each load item are scheduled by day, for five days. The report is found at Maintenance > Reports > Weekly Frag Request. Permission Roles To view/print this report the user needs Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff role. Before using the report CRC: Complete Round Codes (CRC) are entered in the Weapons module by editing the individual Load Item. This is a one-time setup step. Setting: Settings are entered in the Flying Schedule module on each sortie Station. When you enter station Settings, those settings will appear for every Load Item on that Station on the Weekly Frag Request. Settings are normal y fuse settings. Mount: To setup mounts and/or pylons, enter \u201cMount\u201d (case sensitive) as a Load Item Type. Then add your specific mounts and/or pylons as Load Items, making sure to select \u201cMount\u201d as the Load Item Type. This is a one-time setup step. To schedule mounts and/or pylons, add the mount/pylon as a normal load item to a station. Then, onto the same station, schedule other load items that wil be attached to the mount/pylon. On the Frag Report, each load item will now list the mount/pylon \u201cDescription\u201d (not Name) in the Mount column of the report.

Munitions grouping The report groups load items by Squadron, Munition Project Number, and MDS. Quantity (Qty) and Spare (Sp) calculations The Qty column shows the number of that particular load item scheduled for that day on primary aircraft. The Sp column shows the number of that particular load item scheduled for that day on spare aircraft (line numbers which include \"Sp.\"). The TOTAL column at the end shows the total of that particular load item scheduled for that week on primary aircraft plus the last (not total) Spare quantity for the week. In other words, the TOTAL column does not add up al the Sp for the week but uses the last daily value. AF 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination Introduction The PEX AF Form 2407 documents mission changes. Permission Roles To view/print this form the user needs Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff role.

Although they appear the same, each item is a separate instance in the database. This created redundancies and complicated moving people between squadrons. The visibility model handles this by creating a single database instance of the item. The user then selects which squadrons have visibility to the item. However\u2026 !!! danger \"WARNINGs:\" * Changing the item will affect all squadrons with visibility to that item. For example, your database has an Eval Requisite of \u201cVis Recce\u201d and visibility is selected for multiple squadrons. If you change the item to \u201cVisual Recce\u201d it will appear as such in al squadrons, not just yours. This includes squadrons using the item to which you may not have permission. * Because these edits can break data standards for a community which, in turn, negatively impact seamless data transition during Personnel export/import and squadron changes, any edits to Visibility data entries should be coordinated with the database PEX Admin and all using squadrons. * In this example, the database has a single instance of the Eval Type \"TAC.\" The 11RS, 130IS, 132IS and 742MS do not have visibility to TAC. The 80FS and 165AS do have visibility to TAC. If someone in the 80FS changes TAC to TACTICAL, it is changed for the 165AS as well.

LAN Out Procedures \u00b6 Use this procedure if the Local Area Network (LAN) is down for an extended period of time that wil impact your operations. !!! caution \"Caution\" If you have multiple squadrons on the same database, this procedure works for each squadron to conduct PEX operations independently off LAN. However, when the LAN is back operational, only one squadron\u2019s data can be used to update the overal database. The data the other squadrons entered into their independent instance of PEX wil not merge back in. !!! note \"notes\" * The process requires about two hours to accomplish and about two hours to bring your main server back up to date when the LAN is restored. * The PEX Database Manager includes its own help file. Open the Database Manager and click the Help button, or refer to the PEX Database Manager User Manual on the installation disc (documents folder) or PEX web site. Go to the PEX server, use the PEX Database Manager to backup the PEX database, and copy the backup file to a CD/DVD. Use SQL Enterprise Manager to take the PEX database and its archive database offline. Take this CD/DVD to a computer in your squadron that will become your interim PEX server. This machine must be set up as a PEX server according to the PEX Install Guide (i.e., operating system, SQL, Internet Explorer, IIS, MS Office, .NET, PEX DB Manager, etc.). This setup can be done ahead of time. On the interim computer, use the PEX Database Manager to restore the PEX database from the backup file. Name this interim database something other than what your original database was called, e.g., primary DB name: \"PEXVPS\"; interim DB name: \"PEXVPSTemp\". Install ePEX (if required) on the interim computer machine. Create a smal (off LAN) network with the interim computer acting as the PEX server and ePEX web server. Connect a printer(s) to this network. Provide the new Connect To information to your users on the smal network so they can log into the database. Use PEX as normal on this interim system until the LAN is operational. LAN Returns to Operation Procedures (Single squadron, pick one) \u00b6 On the interim computer, use the PEX Database Manager to backup the PEX database, and copy the backup file to a CD/DVD. Go to your main PEX server and use the PEX Database Manager to rename your previous PEX database to something like PEXVPS_OLD. Then, restore the PEX database from your backup file and give it the original database name, e.g., PEXVPS. Tell your users that PEX is back up. The data for that squadron will be current. The data for all other squadrons will be what it was when the LAN went out. Use PEX While Entire Unit Deployed \u00b6 !!! abstract \"Concept\" When your entire unit deploys, there are options on how best to employ PEX. The best option depends upon your circumstances. Regardless of the option you employ, realize up front that there is no way to re-integrate any deployed sortie data from a different database back into your home station database upon your return. Specifically, if while deployed you use PEX in a database on a different server or with a different name from the one which continues to be in use at the home station, that deployed sortie data will never be merged with your home station database. A combination of the options below is possible too. The PEX Help Desk can assist in your decision making. Options \u00b6 Deploy and Use Home Station PEX Reasons For: You do not supply hardware or software Your deployment package does not include supporting assets No installation required at deployed location PEX processes are not subject to local procedures Home station has complete visibility Host location command and control can be granted access to your schedule, etc. Reasons Against: If the deployed schedule is classified this solution will not work Requires connectivity from a potentially austere location Operations difficult to combine with other flying units using PEX at deployed location Probably have to double enter a partial schedule in another system at deployed location Deploy with Your Database on Your Own Hardware Reasons For: PEX is set up as desired before deployment No installation required at deployed location PEX processes are not subject to local procedures This is an approved configuration for a classified environment Reasons Against: You must supply additional hardware and software If the environment is classified, your supporting hardware will return classified You must account for the additional hardware in your deployment package You wil probably not be integrated into the existing network, thus you wil have no single flying operations solution Probably have to double enter a partial schedule in another system at deployed location Deploy with Your Database, Install on Host Hardware Reasons For: You do not supply additional hardware or software Your deployment package does not need to include supporting assets Minimal installation required at deployed location A large amount of the preparation can be accomplished ahead of time PEX processes are not subject to local procedures Can work for either a classified or unclassified environment Determine in advance home station visibility, dependent on host network configuration Host location access is limited only by the status of their network; command and control can be granted access to your schedule, etc. Reasons Against: Assumes the host is supplying all required software (SQL Server) You may not have a single flying operations solution Probably have to double enter a partial schedule in another system at deployed location Add Your Unit to Existing PEX Database Reasons For: Established PEX processes at the deployed location Thoroughly integrated operations, single flying schedule solution and command visibility No dual entry No need to provide hardware or software No need to account for hardware in your deployment package Reasons Against: Nothing is set up before arrival, much unit validation data will have to be tailored Detailed Instructions For Using Pex with Entire Squadron Deployed \u00b6 Deploy and Use Home Station PEX \u00b6 Verify with your Communications Squadron the VPN solution in place. The usual solution is Microsoft Terminal Services, but there are others. Some of these other solutions may require supporting software at the deployed location. You may find your base has no solution installed. Verify with the deployed location that they can access your VPN solution. This should be accomplished by having them attempt to connect from a machine you wil be using during your deployment. It is possible that the network configuration at the deployed location could limit your access. These connectivity issues cannot be resolved through PEX. Deploy with Your Database on Your Own Hardware \u00b6 Configure a computer to function as a database server and another to function as a web server. This is done before you install any component of PEX. Refer to the PEX Installation Guide for minimum hardware requirements. Essentially, you need a mid-level processor and memory capability. If you are going to network the hardware on your arrival, then the full version of SQL is recommended. If the entire PEX application is to be run from the one machine, then SQL Express wil suffice. In either case the PEX Installation Guide should be read first to ensure you adhere to some specific settings required of SQL. An IIS web server is not required if you do not intend to network PEX. On a stand-alone computer, all you need is WinPEX. Install the PEX DB Manager, PEX Service Host, (ePEX, if networked), and WinPEX. Refer to the Installation Guide. After you have your home station database as current as possible with deployed information go to your server, use the PEX DB Manager and back up your database. Do this at the last minute before you deploy so that you have the most current scheduling data, Stan/Eval data, training data, etc. Take the backup file and copy it to your deploying server, then use the DB Manager to restore it (see the help files for specific steps). !!! note \"note\" If you are deploying and you were given leftover hardware/software, you may have a SQL compatibility issue. For example, you can restore a DB created in SQL Server 2005 into an instance of SQL Server 2008, but not the other way around. SQL Server 2005 wil not be able to restore a DB created in SQL Server 2008. Log into the new database on the deploying machine to confirm operation/functionality. Then: Delete extraneous squadrons you don\u2019t need for the deployment Delete extraneous validation items that you don\u2019t need for the deployment Add validation items you need for the deployment Delete extraneous aircraft tail numbers you don\u2019t need for the deployment (or un-check Show in Drop Down) Add aircraft tail numbers you need for the deployment Delete extraneous users you don\u2019t need for the deployment Add new users you need for the deployment and set permissions Move extraneous personnel you don\u2019t need for the deployment to the PCS Squadron Add personnel you need for the deployment Add locations you need for the deployment (delete or hide unneeded ones) Change user permissions needing to be added or removed for the deployment Change the log file paths for the following: ARMS imports and exports; ATO imports; and ACO Delete missions you don\u2019t need for the deployment Deploy with Your Database, Instal on Host Hardware \u00b6 Verify the version of SQL Server running at the deployed location is the same or newer than the one you are using at home station. If they are running a version of SQL Server older than the one you are running, you will not be able to restore your database on their server. The only solutions would be to upgrade the deployed location SQL Server or use a different option. Verify the PEX version at the deployed location. PEX implements compatibility checks and will work only when all aspects of the program are the same version. I.e., the database, PEX Database Manager, ePEX, and WinPEX all have to be the same version. If the deployed location is running a different version of PEX, the only solutions would be to upgrade the deployed location PEX version or use a different option. After you have your home station database as current as possible with deployed information go to your server, use the PEX DB Manager and back up your database. Do this at the last minute before you deploy so that you have the most current scheduling data, Stan/Eval data, training data, etc. Take the backup file and copy it to your deploying server, then use the DB Manager to restore it (see the help files for specific steps). Log into the new database on the deploying machine to confirm operation/functionality. Then: Delete extraneous squadrons you don\u2019t need for the deployment Delete extraneous validation items that you don\u2019t need for the deployment Add validation items you need for the deployment Delete extraneous aircraft tail numbers you don\u2019t need for the deployment (or un-check Show in Drop Down) Add aircraft tail numbers you need for the deployment Delete extraneous users you don\u2019t need for the deployment Add new users you need for the deployment and set permissions Move extraneous personnel you don\u2019t need for the deployment to the PCS Squadron Add personnel you need for the deployment Add locations you need for the deployment (delete or hide unneeded ones) Change user permissions needing to be added or removed for the deployment Change the log file paths for the following: ARMS imports and exports; ATO imports; and ACO imports Delete missions you don\u2019t need for the deployment Add Your Unit to Existing PEX Database \u00b6 Launch the Squadrons module and add the units/squadrons that wil be using PEX plus a \"PCS\" squadron to which you will eventually move people that have left your unit. Once the squadrons are entered, personnel data can be added through the ARMS Interface or manual y through the Personnel module. If your unit does not use ARMS, in the Personnel module, Setup tab, pick a unit and customize your lists. Once you are done with one squadron, you can use the right-click \"Send To\" command to copy the lists over to other units. In the Personnel module, add your personnel manual y. Launch the Aircraft module and enter your aircraft MDSs and tail numbers. In the Users & Permissions module, assign other PEX users and grant them levels of access to the various PEX applications. Use PEX Deployed, Integrated Squadrons \u00b6 This assumes the flying schedule is not built in unclassified PEX beforehand, but that you are entering data into PEX after flight for flying hours and training accomplishments. Our recommendation is; use home station database via ePEX for everything, except when the jet and crew come from different bases, and then use paper 781s. When you arrive at the deployed location, login to your ePEX, and add the other squadron crew to your Personnel module (just minimum information), in your squadron. When the deployment is over, move them to the PCS squadron. In the Personnel module, on the Details tab, for the other squadron crew, check the box for \"Do Not Export 781 Data\" and enter their 781 Flying ORGN. During deployment, as soon as possible after the sortie lands, login to the home station ePEX for the unit that owns the tail number. Using the ePEX Flying Schedule, Sorties tab, add the sortie and on the sortie, enter MDS, Tail Number, Mission Number, Mission Symbol (MUC), Takeoff Location, Land Location, Flight Auth Number, and associate the sortie to a flying hours account. Al this can be done in ePEX (don't need Mission Board). On the Crew tab, schedule the crew (from either squadron) and in Crew Details, enter the crew Duty Position and Pay status. Get this done before MX debrief. AFTO 781. At MX Debrief, have a computer with access to both units' ePEXs. An icon for each on the desktop works well. When the crew arrives at MX Debrief, cal up the ePEX for the unit that owns the tail number. Go to the Squadron Daily Schedule (SDS) and the sortie will show up with a 781 link and a TAR link. The crew would click on the 781 link, fill out the electronic 781, get a MX Review and initials, and print out the 781 for MX. If the crew and jet belong to the same unit, done. The flight managers can export the PEX 781 data to ARMS. (No need for a paper 781 for ARMS) If the crew does not belong to the same unit as the jet, they wil need to bring a copy of the 781 to their flight managers for direct entry of Aircrew Data into ARMS. TAR. If the crew belongs to the same unit as the tail number, the crew, on the SDS, clicks on the TAR link and fil s out the TAR. If the crew belongs to the other unit, the crew wil need to open up the other ePEX (theirs) and navigate to Training> Continuation> Reporting tab> and Person hyperlink and fill out the TAR. Use PEX on NIPR and SIPR (Deployed) \u00b6 If your missions are classified but your other PEX data is unclassified, usually as a result of deployed operations, we recommend the following implementation: Use SIPR PEX for ATO scheduling, sortie execution, and aircraft maintenance data. Use NIPR PEX for Go/No-Go, FCIF, PRF, and Stan Eval. When a unit deploys to your location, the home station flight management office would use their PEX Personnel module to export to file each person's PEX data. They would ensure the files make it to your location, where each person's data would be imported into both your SIPR and NIPR PEX databases. This would provide the NIPR and SIPR databases al the current PEX data on each deployed person. Each day, double-enter, minimum, unclassified, sortie data into the NIPR PEX so that NIPR AFTO 781s and continuation training data could be logged. This minimum data would be: MDS Tail Number Mission Number Mission Symbol Takeoff Location Land Location Sched T/O Time (can be bogus) Sched Land Time (can be bogus) Assign Crew When the crew gets back from flying, they would use your NIPR Squadron Daily Schedule page to enter their AFTO 781 data and to log their training events. The deployed squadron flight management would then use your NIPR PEX to audit, approve, and export to ARMS the 781 and training data. No 781s or training events would be logged on your SIPR side. Once the 781 data and training events are pushed from the NIPR PEX into ARMS, the deployed flight management office would run the three Jaspersoft browsers we provide to extract data from ARMs. They would then import the three resultant .CSV files into both the NIPR and SIPR databases. This would keep both databases (NIPR and SIPR) current with aircrew flying time (to track maximum flying hours) and training currencies. Having the data in both systems is important so you have current and matching data for aircrew scheduling (SIPR) and Go/No-Go (NIPR). When a unit heads back home, the deployed flight management office would use the NIPR PEX Personnel module to export to file each person's PEX data. They would ensure the files make it to home station, where each person's data would be imported into the NIPR PEX back home. Use Your Logo Instead of US DoD \u00b6 Although the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is the primary user of PEX, you may be from another U.S. department, e.g., Dept. of Homeland Security, or from another country, e.g., Australia, Poland, or Oman.

This typically happens in Reserve or Guard units when a person has a crewmember CAC and another contractor CAC. The question arises, which CAC should be associated to their PEX account? Our recommendations: This individual should be identified in the Personnel module only once. This individual should be identified in the Users module only once. The Person and User should be associated in the Users module. The User should be associated to only one network account (CAC) in the Users module. That CAC should be the one they use the most. When they use the other CAC to logon the network, they would not be able to logon to PEX. !!! Caution CAUTION Despite our recommendation, if you think the individual really needs to access PEX using both network accounts (CACs), then: * This individual should be identified in the Users module twice. * Each User should be associated to only one network account (CAC) in the Users module. * This individual should be identified in the Personnel module only once. * Associate one user account (the military one) with the Personnel record. * Do not associate the other user account \\(the contractor one\\) with any Personnel record. * Via policy (PEX can\u2019t enforce this), one User/Person combination should be used to manage the individual\u2019s schedule, training, and Stan Eval. The other User account would be used for the individual to accomplish PEX administrative duties, for example. Security Identifier \u00b6 The PEX Security Identifier is used to sign off FCIFs, proctor tests, and pilot review AFTO 781s. The Security Identifier is defaulted to the person\u2019s ID number (typically, the Social Security Number). The Security Identifier can be changed only by the user and requires six to nine characters, case-sensitive. Change your Security Identifier From My Page, click My Preferences. In the Security Identifier fields, enter 6-9 characters and re-enter the same characters to confirm your change. Using the same number as your CAC PIN, so you don\u2019t have to remember another password, is acceptable. Click Save Preferences. If you forget your Security Identifier, click the \u201cReset to Personal ID Number\u201d button. This resets your Security Identifier to the Personal ID Number (usual y SSN) saved in the Personnel module.","title":"Miscellaneous"},{"location":"PEX/Miscellaneous.html#miscellaneous","text":"","title":"Miscellaneous"},{"location":"PEX/Miscellaneous.html#visibility-model","text":"Originally, units created data items (FCIF, MDS or eval type, for example) in each squadron.

The PEX Go/No-Go module implements a positive control system. The module allows units to customize and display a Go/No-Go board with personnel status, personnel who are current and qualified to perform their missions and personnel who are not current and qualified. The module tracks medical status (DNIF - Duty Not Including Flying), read file signoffs (FCIF - Flight Crew Information File), training tasks (TNG), exams (TEST), Stan Eval (S/E) evaluations, Mission Ready Status, \"Z\" events (FLY) and flying hour maximums (HRS). In addition, units can add customized statuses to suit local needs. Indicators \u00b6 Basic The person has no issues or restrictions. The person has issues that may affect their ability to fly or perform required duties. The person has issues that prevent the person from flying or performing required duties. Status is not yet calculated for the person's qualification. NA Item not used by squadron. See the Legend for specifics on each item. Effective Msn Rdy Status Assigned BMC or CMR, and Assigned and Effective Msn Rdy Status are the same. Assigned BMC or CMR, and Probation for Effective Msn Rdy Status Assigned BMC or CMR, but performance is NBMC or NCMR. Assigned BMC, but performing at CMR. Assigned CMR, effective is calculated at NCMR, but performing at BMC. Permissions Basic User can view the Go/No-Go screen. Stan Eval Admin and Admin can set up Go/No-Go functionality. The following can override Go/No-Go module statuses. Permission Role DNIF TNG TEST Custom Setup Tab Administrator Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Supervisor of Flying No Yes No No No Operations Desk Yes Yes No Yes No Training Auditor/ARMS Yes No No Yes No Stan Eval Administrator No No Yes Yes Yes Module Notes The default column headers of DNIF and FCIF can be changed in their respective modules. Personnel with multiple MDSs and/or Crew Positions may (depending on the filters used) appear more than once on the Board. For example, a person with MDS qualifications of both B-2A and T-38A may be current on all B-2A training tasks but overdue on a T-38A tasks. That person would be green on the B-2A row and yellow on the T-38A row. Controls Access these features from the PEX Main Menu by navigating to Ops > Go/No-Go.

Letter of X \u00b6 Letter of X Basics \u00b6 Introduction The Letter of X (LoX), also known as the Letter of Certifications, tracks certifications by person. Personnel can by organized into groupings by MDS, CP, etc. Certifications can be organized in unit-defined groups. LoX is database-wide using the visibility concept which allows certifications to be used by all units in the database, provided the certification is marked as visible to those units in the setup. The visibility concept makes it much easier to remove Certifications, Statuses, and Categories when not in use. Permissions PEX Administrator and LoX Administrator - Add, manage, assign, unassign certifications and create templates and custom views. Draft Approver - If draft approver process is enabled, approve and disapprove certification changes. Basic User - View LoX using already created filters, custom views and templates. Module Notes Certifications are tied to specific MDS(s) and Crew Position(s). !!! warning \"Warning\" Changing a LoX item will affect all squadrons with visibility to that item. For example, your database has the certification \u201cSyrian AOR Threat\u201d and visibility is selected for multiple squadrons. If you change the item to \u201cSyrian Air Threat\u201d it will appear as such in al squadrons, not just yours. This includes squadrons using the item to which you may not have permission. For more see [Miscellaneous > Visibility Model]. Definitions Qualification - A qualification is the person\u2019s reason for being in the squadron. It consists of an MDS and Crew Position. A person must have at least one primary qualification, but can have as many secondary qualifications as needed. A person\u2019s qualification (or Qual) is established in Setup > Personnel > Quals Tab. Certification - A Certification is a basic capability that you want to assign to a select person or group of people for scheduling and/or tracking purposes. Draft - A change to a person\u2019s certification. This only applies when the Squadron has chosen to \u201cEnable Draft Process\u201d. A change can be the first time a person is assigned the certification, a change to the person\u2019s status, certification, decertification, recertification, and/or expiration dates, and any remarks associated to the certification. Category - Categories are optional. They are used to organize certifications. Statuses - The range of symbols you want to select from when assigning someone a certification (i.e., X, I, T). The status also includes a definition. The status and definition together makes the status unique, therefore, there can be a status of T \u2013 Training and T \u2013 In Training. Assigned Mission Ready Status - What the person is assigned in the Personnel module Effective Mission Ready Status - Status the person is currently performing at based on the requirements entered in the Continuation Training module. Is Certified - Each status has an \"Is Certified\" option. When checked, anyone with this status will be counted for the respective certification in the Long Range Schedule and will be eligible for display in the Mission Board, Schedule Supervisors dropdown. For example, a status of \"T\" (in training) would have Is Certified unchecked so trainees do not count towards shift requirements, nor would the person appear in the supervisor schedule dropdown. Visibility - An indication of whether a certification can be seen/used by a given unit. LoX Template - The template determines what certifications will be displayed and in what order. It will determine if selected dates will be displayed with the certifications. It contains signature block data and remarks. Certification Date - Optional field to indicate when an individual was certified. Recertification Date - Optional field to indicate when an individual is due for recertification (notionally). Expiration Date - Optional field that, when used (and is a date that is in the past) will cause the person to be Decertified (for expiration) in that certification. Decertification Date - Optional field that can be populated to indicate when a person was Decertified (for cause) in a given certification. Controls These procedures are accessed by navigating from the PEX main menu to Ops > Letter of X. Workspace Setup Set squadron preference to use draft approver. View, edit, add, or delete categories.

These personnel need to be assigned at least one qualification via the Personnel Module, Quals Tab. The key elements in a qualification are the MDS and Crew Position. Setup Categories Go to Setup > Categories. Click Add Category. Enter the name, up to 25 characters, and save. Repeat as needed. For example, if you want to group your certifications under the headings Mission Qualifications and Non-Mission Qualifications, then create those two categories. Status Go to Setup > Status. Click Add Status. Enter the name, up to 5 characters. Enter a Description, up to 30 Characters. Uncheck the Is Certified Box only if you don\u2019t want people assigned this status to count against mission requirements. Save. Repeat for the range of statuses you plan to use. Common use cases would by X (Qualified), I (Instructor), T (Training). !!! caution \"Caution\" Consult someone with database-wide LoX Admin permissions (or higher) before deleting a status from the list of statuses (LoX > Setup > Statuses). Anyone in the database using that status will lose it, even if they are in a different unit to which you do not have permissions. Certifications Go to Setup > Certifications Click Add Certification . Check at least one MDS and Crew Position. Check at least one status. Check the optional category (or categories) you want to associate this certification with. Check the units that will use this certification (this is known as establishing visibility) Click Save !!! note \"Note\" You will be unable to uncheck an MDS or CP setting once the certification is saved. You will still be able to check additional MDS and Crew Position combinations for that certification, but never uncheck. If an expected MDS or CP is not listed, make sure someone is assigned to that MDS and CP in Setup > Personnel Module > Quals Tab. !!! tip \"Tip\" Sometimes units carry certifications which are progressive and exclusive. These can be combined into a single certification with a unique status. For instance, 2-ship flight lead and 4-ship flight lead do not need to be tracked as separate certifications. The Certification could be Flight Lead and the status assigned could be 2F, 4F, and T. Visibility Make certifications visible to, or remove visibility from, squadrons: Check or uncheck the box in the row of the certification and column of the squadron to add or remove visibility. Click the save icon. !!! note \"Note\" You will not be able to add, edit, or delete a certification after you start modifying visibility until you click the save or undo icon. Associate Training Tasks to Certification Associating certifications to training tasks will display the training task status (yellow or pink) from the continuation training module on the LoX display/report. Current training will not show any color coding on the LoX display/report. !!! note \"Note\" When a person assigned a certification that has been associated to a training tasks, if the person is not assigned the assigned the associated training task or goes overdue for completion, then the certification status will be \u201cDT\u201d or Decertified for Training.

ORM \u00b6 Setup ORM \u00b6 Introduction The ORM (Operational Risk Management) module provides a tool for assessing the risk associated with conducting missions under different conditions. The module takes into consideration Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Crew Stress, and user-defined Risk Conditions. Permissions To access and configure ORM > Setup tab: Administrator. To accomplish Risk Analysis: Basic User, OPS Desk, OPS Staff, SOF, or Flight Scheduler. To view the ORM module: Ground Scheduler or Flying Hours roles. Rules If the takeoff time is in the past, you cannot make changes to Risk Conditions or Crew Stress, and the Sortie Risk Value is preserved. If more than one condition is selected within a category, PEX calculates the riskiest condition. Module Notes The Sorties grid displays sorties as setup in Scheduling > Flying Schedule > Crew tab. Selecting a formation shows all formation crewmembers, even though each sortie is independently valued. The ORM module has no functionality for printing a report or for managing supervisor approval of missions. Controls These procedures are accessed by navigating to Ops > ORM. Setup Overview First setup other PEX modules for ORM. Then setup the ORM module itself by establishing Risk Categories, and within each Category, assign Risk Conditions and Values. Determine the Approval Authority Levels for accumulated Risk Levels. Assign Risk Weighting Settings. Setup other PEX modules for ORM Before using ORM, you must customize the data in other PEX modules according to your personnel and mission. Go to: Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Mission Board > Sortie Type Enter a Risk Value between 1 and 10 for each sortie type, 10 being the most risky sortie types. Setup > Personnel In each person's Pri Exp Risk column, enter a subjective risk between 1 and 10 for that person. Low experience equals higher risk. For example, an experienced person might have a value of 2, while an inexperienced person might have a value of 9. In the Setup tab > Crew Position, enter a subjective Risk Weighting percentage between 1 and 100 for each crew positions. The sum of your weightings for all crew positions must equal 100. For example, if you have single-seat fighters, enter 100. If you have a multi-crew mission, enter the percentage that each crew position impacts ORM. For example, Pilot = 75 and Copilot = 25. Setup the ORM module Go to Ops > ORM > Setup tab. Risk Categories - Enter general categories of risk conditions. This list is completely unit-defined. Examples are Ceiling, Visibility, Icing, Precipitation, Crosswinds, and HQ Taskings. Right-click and select the required categories from the Master List. Add it if it is not contained in the Master List. Risk Conditions - The Risk Category column builds from the list of Risk Categories. Right-click and add a row. Select the required Category. Enter a Risk Condition. Enter a Risk Value. Repeat as required other Risk Conditions and Values within each Category. For example: Risk Category Risk Condition Risk Condition Icing Light 3 Icing Moderate 5 Icing Severe 7 Risk Levels - This grid sets Approval Authority Level for accumulated risk values on each sortie. Right-click and add a row. Enter a Max Risk Level value. Enter a Description. Enter a Color. Enter the Approval Authority. For example: Risk Weighting Settings. Risk Weightings - Set the four relative factors, Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Pilot Stress, and Risk Conditions, to total 100. Your risk level totals need to be based on whether you use a risk graph display of raw or weighted as your total values are influenced by this option. For example, if you have a Sortie Type risk value of 5, and a Personnel Experience Risk of 6, Risk Conditions of 4, and Crew Stress of 4, the Raw total is 19. In weighted Example 1 below, if you weighted each of those risk values at 25%, your Sortie Type risk value would be 1.25, Personnel Experience Risk 1.5, Risk Conditions 1.0, and Crew Stress of 1.0. Your total weighted risk is now 4.75. If you have a risk level of 5 or above requiring Squadron DO approval, the example would be above that threshold if using raw risk levels but would be below the threshold for weighted risk levels. Weighted example 2 sets the values at 10, 30, 40, and 20 percent. Risk Graph Display -This radio button selection sets the Sortie Risk display in the ORM tab to display either Raw or Weighted. Save. Labels - Change column headings to fit your unit's terminology. For example, change \"Crew Stress\" to \"Pilot Stress\". Workspace ORM Workflow \u00b6 Introduction Determine Risk Totals by selecting a mission sortie, or sortie within a formation, selecting the various Risk Conditions, and Crew Stress Levels. From this accumulated risk value, view the required approval authority level as configured in Setup. Navigate to Ops > ORM > ORM tab. Select a day and, in the Sorties grid, view missions, formations and sorties. This grid is populated from the Flying Schedule and Mission Board. !!! note \"Note\" Sorties whose takeoff time has passed are no longer editable. Workspace Sorties , by mission and formation. Total Sortie Risk , Raw or Weighted . A white bar indicates no Risk Conditions are selected. A black bar indicates at least one Risk Condition is selected. Risk Conditions . With multiple conditions selected within one category, PEX uses the one with the highest risk factor. Individual Crew Stress Levels . If the sortie is part of a formation, all scheduled formation crewmembers are displayed. Risk Totals, Raw and Weighted. Determine Risk View the Sortie Risk display. At this point, the white horizontal bar(s) show Total Risk based on Sortie Type and crewmember Personnel Experience. Select a sortie (the selected sortie is bordered in yellow), and view the scheduled crewmembers in the Crew Stress grid. In the Risk Conditions grid, select all applicable conditions affecting the sortie, for example, Ceiling and Icing. In the Crew Stress grid, adjust the stress level for each crewmember. The Sortie Risk display bar now shows the accumulated Total Risk and required approval authority level (by color) as configured in Setup. Switch between Raw and Weighted in the Setup tab > Risk Graph Display. The Risk Totals grid show the four risk factors, Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Risk Conditions, and Crew Stress, plus Total Risk, for both (Raw) and (Weighted). For examples see Setup ORM . Waterfall \u00b6 Waterfall Basics \u00b6 Overview The waterfall display shows your sortie schedule in a bar chart format. It is designed to help you monitor your squadron\u2019s daily operations. The initial bar shows scheduled times. A superimposed bar shows actual times. Permissions You need the Basic User role to setup and run the display. If you need to see more than one squadron, you need the Basic User role to that squadron.

Weapons Loads and SCLs \u00b6 The Weapons module is used to define Loads, MDS Stations, and SCLs (Standard Configuration Loads) for use in the flight scheduling module. The Weapons module can be used by transport-type squadrons to schedule cargo. Visibility Use the Load Items Visibility and the SCLs Visibility pages to control which Load Items and SCLs show up in your squadron\u2019s drop-down lists. Load Item Types Load Item Types group similar load items. Examples of Load Item Types are Bombs, Pods, Chaff, and Flares. Right-click to Add, Delete, or Edit. Build a Load Item Load Items represent the combination of different Components that produce a completed weapon. For example, a MK-84 Load Item is comprised of a MK-84 Tail Fin component, MK-84 Main Weapon component, and MK-84 Nose Fuse component. You do not need to identify all components. For simplicity, you can pick just the main component, but every Load Item needs at least a single component. Preparatory Steps (This will reduce clutter as you build a new Load Item): Go to Munitions > Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Go to Munitions > Setup > Components and de-select the checkboxes for Components not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Building Steps: Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder and in the Load Item grid, right-click Add . The Add Load Item dialog displays. At a minimum, select the Category, add a Code (e.g. A or 46), Name (e.g., AIM-9X), and select a Type. CRC, Weight, and Remarks can also be added but are not required. Select from available components (left grid), by clicking and dragging it/them over to the Load Item Components Grid (right grid). When the desired component(s) is moved, select Save. Edit a Load Item Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder. Right-click on the Load Item and select Edit. To remove a component from the Load Item, right-click on the component and select Remove. If your Load Item is in use, you cannot edit the Category or Components. If you need to edit those, rename the Load Item to Load Item_old and re-build the correct Load Item from scratch. Delete a Load Item Normal y, you do not need to delete a Load Item. If you don\u2019t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > Load Items Visibility. If you truly want to delete the Load Item from your database, de-select visibility on the Load Item from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. Identify MDS Stations Create MDS configurations for assigned aircraft models. This is where you enter the stations on an MDS. Fighter examples are 1, 2, etc. Bomber examples are FWD Bomb Bay, AFT Bomb Bay. Go to Munitions > Setup > MDS Stations Select the desired MDS Right-click in the MDS Stations Grid and select Add . Name the Station (e.g. 1 or FWD Bomb Bay). In addition to listing every named MDS station, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares, if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them. To edit or delete a Station, right-click on it. To adjust the order, click and drag the Station. Build an SCL SCLs represent the combination of different Load Items, by MDS, and by Station. For example, on a bomber MDS: 4 (Quantity) B-61 (Load Item) in the Forward Bomb Bay (Station) and 8 CBU-89 in the Aft Bomb Bay. This SCL could be called Standard Nuclear Load 1. A fighter example is: 1 AMRAAM on Station 1, 500 bundles of RR-112 Chaff on Station 3, and 1 AMRAAM on Station 5. This SCL could be called A5A. Quick and Easy Way \u2013 Use this method if all you need is a list of your SCLs to show up for scheduling and you don\u2019t need any information in PEX about the SCL load items or which stations they are on. Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add . The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed (e.g. the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D). When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save. Normal Way \u2013 Use this method if you want the schedulers to know the load items in an SCL and which stations they go on. Preparatory Steps (These will reduce the clutter as you build a new SCL and make the building steps easier): Go to Munitions > Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Go to Munitions > Setup > SCLs Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for SCLs not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Building Steps: Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add. The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. Description is not required, but is recommended. Example SCL names are SCL-01, A5A, Standard Conventional Load. An example SCL description is AIM-9X MAV MAV AIM-9X 500 Rounds. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D. Click and drag the desired load items from the Available Load Items list to the desired Station. To increase the quantity of a load item assigned to a station, double-click the Qty field and edit the number. When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save . Edit an SCL - Right-click on the SCL and select Edit . To remove a Load Item from a Station, right-click on the Load Item and select Delete Load Item. To add a Load Item to a Station, drag it over from the Available Load Items grid. When done editing, click Save . Delete an SCL - Normally, you do not need to delete an SCL. If you don\u2019t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > SCL Visibility. If you truly want to delete the SCL from your database, de-select visibility on the SCL from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. Associate an SCL to a Sortie Type - If a particular Sortie Type almost always uses the same SCL, PEX can default the SCL for you when you use the Mission Board. This does not work using the Flying Schedule Sortie Tab. Go to Setup > Validation > Mission Board > Sortie Type and pick a default SCL for your Sortie Types. Use Automatic Load Codes (formerly known as Auto SCL) Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which we in PEX call Load Code (formerly Auto SCL). For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. If your unit schedules load items this way: Use only a single station on the MDS/sortie. Call it whatever you like, \u201cSortie\u201d would be fine.

That data can then be audited within PEX and exported to the ARMS database. Setup In Training > Continuation > ARMs > Settings > ARMS Data > 781 Data: enter your unit\u2019s HARM Code, 4-character Flying Organization Unit ID, 17-character Flying Organization Unit ID, and the Issuing Unit you want to appear on the AFTO 781. You can find this information on an existing 781. In Maintenance > Aircraft: enter the ARMS MDS and ARMS ID for each MDS and Tail Number. Advise your flight schedulers they must enter the following information for each sortie: MDS, Tail #, Takeoff Location, Land Location, MUC (Mission Symbol) and Flight Authorization #. Advise your crew schedulers to put the aircraft commander at the top of the crew list. Implement In the maintenance debrief office, setup a computer logged into PEX with the Squadron Daily Schedule (SDS) module in view. The SDS lists every sortie scheduled to fly that day. For each sortie, there is an \u201cAFTO 781\u201d link. When the crew gets back from flying, they would click on the 781 link for their sortie, fill out the Mission Data and Aircrew Data, and electronically sign off the pilot review. (They can also fill out their TAR.) The maintenance reviewer would then enter their initials and Save. There are two alternatives to this process but neither way includes a good way to get the maintenance review into PEX: Setup a computer near the Ops Desk for the crew to fill out their 781s and TARs. When a crewmember logs into PEX, on My Page, for every sortie, there is a 781 link, near the TAR link, which brings up the electronic 781. Fil out the PEX AFTO 781 Click on your sortie\u2019s 781 link to launch the PEX AFTO 781 dialog. If you flew on more than one sortie, in the same tail number, on the same day, PEX provides you the option to include those sorties on a single AFTO 781. !!! note \"Note\" ARMS uses only the Mission Number of the first flight in the sequence. Fill out the Mission and Aircrew Data. Anyone can fill out the 781. !!! note \"Note\" You can use one of three different mission numbers. To pick, click Select next to Mission Number at the top of the 781 dialog. Choose either (PEX) Mission Number, AMC Mission Number, or Maintenance Line Number. This is a squadron-wide setting and will be retained for future 781s until changed again. !!! note \"Note\" If the tail number (or MDS) changed at the last minute, you can click on the ARMS MDS or ARMS Serial # Edit links at the top of the dialog and update. The Aircraft Commander signs off the Pilot Review using their PEX PIN (mandatory). This readies the 781 for SARM audit and export to ARMS. The Maintenance Debriefer types in their initials and signs off their review (optional but recommended). Print out the 781 and leave the hard copy with Maintenance.","title":"OPS"},{"location":"PEX/Ops.html#ops","text":"","title":"OPS"},{"location":"PEX/Ops.html#fcif","text":"Introduction The FCIF (Flight Crew Information File) page is used to view the status of individuals' read file items.

The module takes into consideration Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Crew Stress, and user-defined Risk Conditions. Permissions To access and configure ORM > Setup tab: Administrator. To accomplish Risk Analysis: Basic User, OPS Desk, OPS Staff, SOF, or Flight Scheduler. To view the ORM module: Ground Scheduler or Flying Hours roles. Rules If the takeoff time is in the past, you cannot make changes to Risk Conditions or Crew Stress, and the Sortie Risk Value is preserved. If more than one condition is selected within a category, PEX calculates the riskiest condition. Module Notes The Sorties grid displays sorties as setup in Scheduling > Flying Schedule > Crew tab. Selecting a formation shows all formation crewmembers, even though each sortie is independently valued. The ORM module has no functionality for printing a report or for managing supervisor approval of missions. Controls These procedures are accessed by navigating to Ops > ORM. Setup Overview First setup other PEX modules for ORM. Then setup the ORM module itself by establishing Risk Categories, and within each Category, assign Risk Conditions and Values. Determine the Approval Authority Levels for accumulated Risk Levels. Assign Risk Weighting Settings. Setup other PEX modules for ORM Before using ORM, you must customize the data in other PEX modules according to your personnel and mission. Go to: Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Mission Board > Sortie Type Enter a Risk Value between 1 and 10 for each sortie type, 10 being the most risky sortie types. Setup > Personnel In each person's Pri Exp Risk column, enter a subjective risk between 1 and 10 for that person. Low experience equals higher risk. For example, an experienced person might have a value of 2, while an inexperienced person might have a value of 9. In the Setup tab > Crew Position, enter a subjective Risk Weighting percentage between 1 and 100 for each crew positions. The sum of your weightings for all crew positions must equal 100. For example, if you have single-seat fighters, enter 100. If you have a multi-crew mission, enter the percentage that each crew position impacts ORM. For example, Pilot = 75 and Copilot = 25. Setup the ORM module Go to Ops > ORM > Setup tab. Risk Categories - Enter general categories of risk conditions. This list is completely unit-defined. Examples are Ceiling, Visibility, Icing, Precipitation, Crosswinds, and HQ Taskings. Right-click and select the required categories from the Master List. Add it if it is not contained in the Master List. Risk Conditions - The Risk Category column builds from the list of Risk Categories. Right-click and add a row. Select the required Category. Enter a Risk Condition. Enter a Risk Value. Repeat as required other Risk Conditions and Values within each Category. For example: Risk Category Risk Condition Risk Condition Icing Light 3 Icing Moderate 5 Icing Severe 7 Risk Levels - This grid sets Approval Authority Level for accumulated risk values on each sortie. Right-click and add a row. Enter a Max Risk Level value. Enter a Description. Enter a Color. Enter the Approval Authority. For example: Risk Weighting Settings. Risk Weightings - Set the four relative factors, Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Pilot Stress, and Risk Conditions, to total 100. Your risk level totals need to be based on whether you use a risk graph display of raw or weighted as your total values are influenced by this option. For example, if you have a Sortie Type risk value of 5, and a Personnel Experience Risk of 6, Risk Conditions of 4, and Crew Stress of 4, the Raw total is 19. In weighted Example 1 below, if you weighted each of those risk values at 25%, your Sortie Type risk value would be 1.25, Personnel Experience Risk 1.5, Risk Conditions 1.0, and Crew Stress of 1.0. Your total weighted risk is now 4.75. If you have a risk level of 5 or above requiring Squadron DO approval, the example would be above that threshold if using raw risk levels but would be below the threshold for weighted risk levels.

The Weapons module can be used by transport-type squadrons to schedule cargo. Visibility Use the Load Items Visibility and the SCLs Visibility pages to control which Load Items and SCLs show up in your squadron\u2019s drop-down lists. Load Item Types Load Item Types group similar load items. Examples of Load Item Types are Bombs, Pods, Chaff, and Flares. Right-click to Add, Delete, or Edit. Build a Load Item Load Items represent the combination of different Components that produce a completed weapon. For example, a MK-84 Load Item is comprised of a MK-84 Tail Fin component, MK-84 Main Weapon component, and MK-84 Nose Fuse component. You do not need to identify all components. For simplicity, you can pick just the main component, but every Load Item needs at least a single component. Preparatory Steps (This will reduce clutter as you build a new Load Item): Go to Munitions > Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Go to Munitions > Setup > Components and de-select the checkboxes for Components not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Building Steps: Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder and in the Load Item grid, right-click Add . The Add Load Item dialog displays. At a minimum, select the Category, add a Code (e.g. A or 46), Name (e.g., AIM-9X), and select a Type. CRC, Weight, and Remarks can also be added but are not required. Select from available components (left grid), by clicking and dragging it/them over to the Load Item Components Grid (right grid). When the desired component(s) is moved, select Save. Edit a Load Item Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder. Right-click on the Load Item and select Edit. To remove a component from the Load Item, right-click on the component and select Remove. If your Load Item is in use, you cannot edit the Category or Components. If you need to edit those, rename the Load Item to Load Item_old and re-build the correct Load Item from scratch. Delete a Load Item Normal y, you do not need to delete a Load Item. If you don\u2019t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > Load Items Visibility. If you truly want to delete the Load Item from your database, de-select visibility on the Load Item from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. Identify MDS Stations Create MDS configurations for assigned aircraft models. This is where you enter the stations on an MDS. Fighter examples are 1, 2, etc. Bomber examples are FWD Bomb Bay, AFT Bomb Bay. Go to Munitions > Setup > MDS Stations Select the desired MDS Right-click in the MDS Stations Grid and select Add . Name the Station (e.g. 1 or FWD Bomb Bay). In addition to listing every named MDS station, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares, if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them. To edit or delete a Station, right-click on it. To adjust the order, click and drag the Station. Build an SCL SCLs represent the combination of different Load Items, by MDS, and by Station. For example, on a bomber MDS: 4 (Quantity) B-61 (Load Item) in the Forward Bomb Bay (Station) and 8 CBU-89 in the Aft Bomb Bay. This SCL could be called Standard Nuclear Load 1. A fighter example is: 1 AMRAAM on Station 1, 500 bundles of RR-112 Chaff on Station 3, and 1 AMRAAM on Station 5. This SCL could be called A5A. Quick and Easy Way \u2013 Use this method if all you need is a list of your SCLs to show up for scheduling and you don\u2019t need any information in PEX about the SCL load items or which stations they are on. Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add . The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed (e.g. the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D). When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save. Normal Way \u2013 Use this method if you want the schedulers to know the load items in an SCL and which stations they go on. Preparatory Steps (These will reduce the clutter as you build a new SCL and make the building steps easier): Go to Munitions > Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Go to Munitions > Setup > SCLs Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for SCLs not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Building Steps: Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add. The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. Description is not required, but is recommended. Example SCL names are SCL-01, A5A, Standard Conventional Load. An example SCL description is AIM-9X MAV MAV AIM-9X 500 Rounds. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D. Click and drag the desired load items from the Available Load Items list to the desired Station. To increase the quantity of a load item assigned to a station, double-click the Qty field and edit the number. When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save . Edit an SCL - Right-click on the SCL and select Edit . To remove a Load Item from a Station, right-click on the Load Item and select Delete Load Item. To add a Load Item to a Station, drag it over from the Available Load Items grid. When done editing, click Save . Delete an SCL - Normally, you do not need to delete an SCL. If you don\u2019t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > SCL Visibility. If you truly want to delete the SCL from your database, de-select visibility on the SCL from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. Associate an SCL to a Sortie Type - If a particular Sortie Type almost always uses the same SCL, PEX can default the SCL for you when you use the Mission Board. This does not work using the Flying Schedule Sortie Tab. Go to Setup > Validation > Mission Board > Sortie Type and pick a default SCL for your Sortie Types. Use Automatic Load Codes (formerly known as Auto SCL) Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which we in PEX call Load Code (formerly Auto SCL). For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. If your unit schedules load items this way: Use only a single station on the MDS/sortie. Call it whatever you like, \u201cSortie\u201d would be fine. Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them. PEX will generate a Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board, once a Tail Number is selected.","title":"Weapons Loads and SCLs"},{"location":"PEX/Ops.html#weapons-training","text":"The Weapons Module is used to track weapons deployment and scoring for the unit.

That data can then be audited within PEX and exported to the ARMS database. Setup In Training > Continuation > ARMs > Settings > ARMS Data > 781 Data: enter your unit\u2019s HARM Code, 4-character Flying Organization Unit ID, 17-character Flying Organization Unit ID, and the Issuing Unit you want to appear on the AFTO 781. You can find this information on an existing 781. In Maintenance > Aircraft: enter the ARMS MDS and ARMS ID for each MDS and Tail Number. Advise your flight schedulers they must enter the following information for each sortie: MDS, Tail #, Takeoff Location, Land Location, MUC (Mission Symbol) and Flight Authorization #. Advise your crew schedulers to put the aircraft commander at the top of the crew list. Implement In the maintenance debrief office, setup a computer logged into PEX with the Squadron Daily Schedule (SDS) module in view. The SDS lists every sortie scheduled to fly that day. For each sortie, there is an \u201cAFTO 781\u201d link. When the crew gets back from flying, they would click on the 781 link for their sortie, fill out the Mission Data and Aircrew Data, and electronically sign off the pilot review. (They can also fill out their TAR.) The maintenance reviewer would then enter their initials and Save. There are two alternatives to this process but neither way includes a good way to get the maintenance review into PEX: Setup a computer near the Ops Desk for the crew to fill out their 781s and TARs.

Best Practice Existing PEX sorties cannot be linked to imported ATO sorties. If you build a flying schedule in PEX, in anticipation of an ATO, when you subsequently import the ATO into PEX, you wil end up with two sets of sorties: your anticipated sorties and your imported ATO sorties. You do not want this. What you want is a single set of sorties with your ATO data. To do that: Build your anticipated ATO flying schedule outside of PEX, in Excel for example. This anticipated schedule would include: # of Lines and Formations, MDS, Tail Number, SCLs, Crew, Show, and Brief Times. Import the ATO into PEX. Let PEX build the draft flying schedule based on the ATO. Transfer the data from your anticipated schedule (Tail #, SCLs, Crew, Show, and Brief Times) into the ATO-imported sorties in PEX. Import an ATO into PEX In the ATO module, browse to the location of the ATO file. PEX reads the ATO and displays aircraft missions in the Mission Summary grid. Non-aircraft missions are not displayed, e.g., naval missile taskings (a MTGTLOC data set with no accompanying MSNACFT data set). The grid displays either all ATO missions or just the missions for the ATO units you have mapped to a PEX squadron, depending on your selection. By default, the ATO mission goes to the mapped squadron and is assigned to the default aircraft type (MDS) for that squadron, but these can be changed before importing. Select the missions you want to add to the PEX database. If required, update the squadrons and MDSs to which the missions wil be assigned in PEX and click Import/Update. After you import, PEX saves general ATO data and all the data tied to the missions you selected. Some of the imported mission data is not viewable in the PEX Mission Board but all data for a selected mission is available in the PEX database via web services. Data for missions not selected in the Mission Summary grid is not saved to the PEX database. !!! Note A mission is identified as having a target (TGT) if it includes any of the following ATO data sets: GTGTLOC, MTGTLOC, or SHIPTGT. A mission is identified as having air refueling (AR) if it includes any of the following ATO data sets: ARINFO, 5REFUEL, or REFTSK. Associate your PEX Squadron to an ATO Unit As a time-saver, once you know how your PEX squadron is identified in the ATO, link it so you don\u2019t have to select it in the Mission Summary grid for every mission you want imported. To do this, click the Display Only Mapped Squadrons hyperlink and a grid will appear listing all the PEX squadrons and a place to type in the ATO designation for each. PEX Missions ATO missions do not match one-for-one to PEX missions but they wil have the same mission number. An ATO mission may contain multiple MDSs. A PEX mission is created for each ATO mission MSNACFT data set. In other words, if the ATO mission contains a MSNACFT data set for F15E and another for B52H; PEX will create two missions, one for the F15E and another for the B52H. PEX Sorties PEX will create sorties based on the number of aircraft in the MSNACFT data set and/or the number of legs in AIRMOVE taskings. PEX will apply its formation logic to multi-aircraft (MSNACFT) missions. Takeoff and Land Locations PEX establishes these locations from the ATO AMSNDAT set DEPLOC and ARRLOC fields. If there are no values in those fields, then PEX uses the Mission Board user-defined default takeoff location. !!! caution Your Database could have three instances of the same location, for example: PEX KDMA, ATO KDMA, and ACO KDMA. If you imported an ACO, then the locations have relatively complete definitions including Lat/Long coordinates. When the ATO import occurs, PEX will look to see if you have an ACO location that matches (e.g., ACO KDMA). If it finds it, then it uses that one on for the sortie. If it does not find it, it searches for an ATO location (e.g., ATO KDMA) and uses it. If it finds neither, it creates a new location of Source = ATO and uses that one. The issue for you is that PEX creates the ATO location KDMA, but it does not know its Lat/Long. Go to Setup > Locations and enter Lat/Longs for frequently used ATO locations. Takeoff and Land Times ATOs do not normally specify takeoff or land times. PEX calculates an estimated takeoff and land time for each ATO sortie. For speed, PEX uses the Speed entered in the Aircraft Module for the sortie MDS. If no speed is entered, PEX uses 350 knots ground speed. To determine takeoff time, PEX uses the first controlled (frozen) sortie event time, for example, a 5REFUEL with an ARCT of 10:40 at location EXXON BLUE. If PEX finds the Lat/Long of EXXON BLUE (from the ACO import) and if PEX finds the Lat/Long of the takeoff location, then PEX calculates a reasonable time enroute. If that turns out to be 35 minutes, then PEX calculates an estimated takeoff time of 10:05. If any of the required Lat/Long information is missing, PEX defaults to one hour prior, or 09:40 in our example. To calculate an estimated land time, PEX uses the last control ed (frozen) sortie event time. Controlled (Frozen) Times PEX creates Sortie Events with frozen times for the following ATO data sets: AIRDROP (airdrop mission data) AMSNLOC (location data for missions with no target) ARINFO (refueling data for the receiver) ASACSDAT (air control data) (no time) ASUPTFOR (data on missions being supported) (no time) CONTROLA (control data) (no time) GTGTLOC (target location and description) MTGTLOC (missile target data) PTRCPLOT (reconnaissance mission location data) (no time) RECCEDAT (reconnaissance data) REFTSK (refueling data for the tanker) SHIPTGT (naval target data) 1MSNRTE (data on an established flight route) 5REFUEL (receiver refueling data for the tanker) 7CONTROL (data on controlled assets) ATO Changes Handle an ATO update just like an original ATO: browse to the change ATO file, select your missions, and click Import/Update. Missions with a gray background in the Squadron and Aircraft fields are already in PEX and wil be updated when you select Import/Update. Missions with a white background in the Squadron and Aircraft fields are new missions and will be added to PEX when you select Import/Update. The log file will provide a list of cancelled, added, and updated missions. !!! danger Before importing an ATO change, ensure the original ATO has been imported. Check the Log Files to verify which ATOs and updates have been imported. If you inadvertently import an older version of the ATO than the one already in PEX, all subsequent ATO changes must be re-imported to ensure you have the latest data. !!! caution PEX pre-selects all the missions in the Mission Summary grid for updating and adding. Unless you have a good reason for not updating or adding a mission, do not un-check the box next to the mission before clicking Import/Update. Missions. If an ATO mission is cancelled, it will be cancelled in PEX. If the ATO update adds a mission, it will display in the Mission Summary grid so that it can be selected and added to the PEX database. Sorties. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination matches one already in PEX, PEX updates the ATO data for the original mission. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination has more aircraft than the original, an additional sortie(s) is added to PEX. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination has fewer aircraft than the original, PEX cancels the extra sortie(s). AIRMOVE. If the number of AIRMOVE taskings differs in the update from the current number of AIRMOVE taskings, PEX cancels all of that mission's sorties and adds new sorties in their place. If the number of AIRMOVE taskings is the same, PEX updates the data for the sorties. Sortie Events. The data from the first updated ATO data set that matches an ATO data set in the original ATO is used to update only the ATO fields for that data set. For example, if the original ATO mission included a GTGTLOC, then the first GTGTLOC data set in the change ATO for that mission is used to update the original. Data entered manually through PEX for that GTGTLOC sortie event remains unaffected. If an additional ATO data set is in the change ATO, it is added to the mission. Using the previous example, if the original ATO had only one GTGTLOC and the change ATO includes two for the same mission, the additional GTGTLOC is added as another sortie event in PEX. If the change ATO does not contain a data set that was included in the original ATO, the sortie event is deleted from PEX for that mission. Troubleshooting \u2013 Not All ATO Missions Show Up When you browse to an ATO file, PEX parses out the units so you can pick which ones to import. If you know PEX did not list all the ATO units, there is a parsing problem, most likely caused by an ATO format error. When PEX encounters an ATO format error, subsequent units do not show up in the PEX list. To troubleshoot a problematic ATO: Save the original ATO and make five copies. In the first ATO copy, delete an entire TASKCNTRY section (including all its TASKUNITs). Save the modified ATO and use the PEX ATO module to browse to it again. PEX will parse out the units. If all the correct units show up, the ATO format problem is somewhere in the TASKCNTRY section you deleted. If all the correct units still do not show up, the problem is in another TASKCNTRY section. Keep removing TASKCNTRY sections until the ATO parses ok and you wil have identified the problematic TASKCNTRY section. In the second ATO copy, now that you\u2019ve identified the problematic TASKCNTRY section, repeat the above removal procedures for TASKUNIT sections (within the problematic TASKNTRY) until you identify the problematic TASKUNIT. In the third ATO copy, now that you've identified the problematic TASKUNIT, repeat the above removal procedures for each AMSNDAT group (including all sub-sets, such as MSNACFT, ARINFO, AMPN, GTGTLOC, etc.) until you identify the problematic mission (AMSNDAT group). In the fourth ATO copy, now that you've identified the problematic mission group, remove its subsets, one-by-one, until the ATO parses ok. Once you've identified the problematic sub-set (AMPN for example), compare its format to the USMTF approved format and you should find the problem, for example, one too many slashes. In the fifth ATO copy, fix the error manually and use the PEX ATO module to browse to it. It should parse correctly and list all units.

Commitments Board \u00b6 Commitments Board- Basics Introduction The Commitments Board (CB) module allows you to build a schedule of non-flying activities. These activities are cal ed commitments because resources which need to be scheduled can be both people and equipment, therefore this module provides the flexibility to commit either one or both of these types of resources. It is a multi-faceted module all owing a unit scheduler to tie multiple commitments together into Events, create specific crew templates to match desired qualifications and crew positions, or to use the product functionality of the module to generate a mission planning sheet (MPS) or output a date range of commitments to an excel spreadsheet. Permissions Three permission roles can access Commitment Board, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator: Operations Desk, Flying Schedule or Ground Scheduling permissions allow for access to work within the Commitment Board module. Basis User permissions are required to create a personal commitment form an individual\u2019s MyPage. Permission roles are assigned in Users & Permissions. Rules Using the Events function, a scheduler can place an equipment commitment and a person commitment together within the CB module. However the equipment commitment portion wil not show up on the individuals MyPage. Only Personnel Commitments show on an individual\u2019s MyPage. Module Notes There are two different selections to make on the PEX Main Menu depending if you are in WinPEX or ePEX. For WinPEX, navigate to Scheduling > Commitments Board Web For ePEX, navigate to Scheduling > Commitments Board Workspace Squadron selection.

Click OK. Repeat this step for every different type of crewmember/event combination. In the Summary grid, PEX calculates the number of sorties and hours required for this account based on the values you entered. These hours would be your requested Allocated hours. Flying Hours, Quick Setup These instructions will get your Flying Hour Plan (FHP) setup quickly to allow you time later on to become more familiar with other advanced features not addressed here. For many units, this quick setup may be enough, even long-term. Go to PEX Scheduling > Flying Hours module > Flying Hours tab. In the Flying Hours Account grid, right-click and select Add. In the Flying Hours Account dialog, select the MDS(s) for the account, enter the Allocated Hours, Start Date (usually 1 October), End Date (usually 30 Sep), Version = 1, and give the Account a name (e.g., FY15 F-16 O&M). Click Save. !!! Note Enter the actual start date of the flying account, even if you are already in the midst of execution. PEX will allow you later on to tell it what\u2019s already happened, using the Override Data command. Notice the new account shows up in the grid. Click on it to select it. Notice in the bottom Attrition/ASD grid that the Total Hours have been spread out evenly across the months. Click on any of the Hours cells and a Total Allocated Hours dialog comes up. Change the monthly hours to match your contracted hours with Maintenance for each month, ensuring they still add up to the Total. When done, click Save. A dialog will read: \u201cYou should now go to the Weekly or Monthly view\u2026\u201d Ignore this dialog for the moment and click OK. Back in the Attrition/ASD grid, enter your expected Attrition and ASD for each month. Just before the flight schedulers start building missions that wil be charged to this FHP, have them go to Mission Board > Tools > Pre-Mission Settings > Add Sortie > and set the default FHP to what you just created. This way, when they add missions, the default FHP will already be set. Stress to the flight schedulers that every sortie in PEX should have an FHP selected. Stress to the Ops Desk that every sortie\u2019s FHP should be double-checked after it flies. As crews come back from flying and they fill out their PEX AFTO 781, the sortie flying time will automatically feed this Flying Hours module. If you don\u2019t yet use PEX AFTO 781s, then make sure the Actual Takeoff and Land Times are entered in the Mission Board or Flying Schedule modules Use the Flying Hours > Overview tab > Filter icon (top right) to select a particular FHP of interest. Use the Flying Hours > Daily and Graphs pages to monitor FHP execution. Flying Hours, Advanced First, follow the instructions from the Flying Hours, Quick Setup topic to identify and setup your flying hour accounts. Use these advanced instructions to specify no-fly and surge days. By doing so, PEX will calculate how many sorties and hours you should fly daily to properly execute your flying plan. You can then plan your daily flying in detail by identifying flying periods, times, sortie types, and/or number of sorties. Use the Weekly page for all your work as it displays extra data you will need; use the Monthly page for the bigger picture. Pick the Plan. Go to Flying Hours > Weekly page. Select the Flying Hours Settings icon (looks like a funnel) at top-right. Filter down to the single flying plan you are interested in. Starting from the left, select the desired Wing, Group, Squadron, Period, Budget Activity, MDS, PEC, a single Account and a Version is necessary. Establish the Override Date (if required). If you are already in the midst of a flying plan year, tel PEX what has already been flown on that account. On the Weekly page, right-click on any day and select Override Data. Select the month through which you wish to override data. Enter the flying data (Forecast, Planned, Scheduled, and Actual Sorties and Hours) through the end of that month in the plan. PEX uses these values as historical data. Overrides cannot be done by day, only by month. Click Save to save the override data. Click Cancel to exit the dialog without saving any changes. When the next dialog appears, redistribute the remaining monthly hours as desired. Each overridden day will display Data Overridden on the Weekly and Monthly views. You can delete an Override from the Flying Hours Override dialog by clicking on the Delete button. After overriding data, notice your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. Establish the No-Fly Dates. Tell PEX the dates you don\u2019t plan to fly so it wil take those dates out of the calculation. Right-click on any day and select No Fly Days. Select your no fly days and click Save. At the top of the grid are some choices which help you select multiple days easily. For instance, if you choose Sunday then all Sundays will be marked as no-fly. You could then click on any individual Sunday to set it back to a fly day. Or you could choose Federal Holidays and all Federal Holidays will be marked as no-fly. Notice that your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. !!! Note When required, No-Fly Days can quickly be set back to Fly Days (and vice-versa) by right- clicking on the day (in the Weekly view) and selecting the Set as No Fly Day or Set as Fly Day. When you do, notice your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. Establish your Surge or Minimum Fly (Locked) Dates. Tell PEX the dates you want to fly more or less than usual so it can use the information when calculating the required sorties/hours (Calc). Right-click on the desired date and select Change Sorties/Hours. Enter the number of sorties and hours you expect to schedule that day. After the values are entered, a lock will appear on that day. Later, when you re-calculate, PEX will use these manually entered values minus attrition for what you can expect to accomplish for that date. (This is how you tell PEX what you are going to schedule for a given day, instead of PEX recommending what you should schedule.) Notice that your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. Calculate the Plan. On the Weekly page, when the Calc numbers are red, this indicates the numbers are not valid and they need to be re-calculated for the changes you have made. To re-calculate your sorties/hours, first decide on a date from which to reflow the Calculated Hours. If your Flying Plan start date is in the future, you would choose the start date. If your start date is already in the past, you would normal y choose a date in the future (possibly/probably the first of next month), thereby leaving the already agreed upon sorties/hours the same up until the date you select. !!! Note On your selected date, right-click and select Calculate Plan. PEX will then calculate how many sorties/hours you should plan on a given day, taking into account your monthly contract hours, ASD, attrition, and Locked days. Notice that the Calc numbers are no longer red but are now black, indicating they are valid numbers with which to make scheduling decisions. PEX uses the following logic to calculate the sorties/hours on a given date: PEX takes the monthly Contract hours and increases them to account for the attrition factor. E.g., 1000 monthly Contract hours and 15% attrition. The 1000 hours is increased to 1176.47, so when you lose 15% (176.47), you end up with the 1000 desired hours. (Current Month Only) PEX then subtracts the actual hours you have already flown this month from the remaining hours. E.g., 1176.47 minus 100 actual hours equals 1076.47 left to fly this month. PEX then calculates that you want zero hours on No-Fly Days. PEX then uses the number of hours entered through the Change Sorties/Hours dialog on Changed (Locked) Days and lessens the amount by the monthly expected attrition. PEX then divides the remaining hours (e.g., 1076.47) by the monthly ASD to determine the number of sorties that should be flown that month. E.g., 1076.47 hours and ASD of 1.5 equals 717.6 sorties. PEX then distributes the remaining sorties equally among the remaining flying days in the month. It then multiplies the sorties by the monthly ASD to determine how many hours should be flown each day. Plan Sorties/Hours in Detail. Now that PEX has calculated how many sorties/hours you should plan on any given day in your flying plan, you can specify in more detail how those sorties will be scheduled. Planning the sorties/hours to this level of detail is optional but many units find it helpful for coordination with Maintenance and outside organizations. To plan sorties/hours in detail, right-click on the desired date and select Plan Sorties. In the Planned Sorties dialog, right-click in the grid and select Add. Select a Flying Period from the list and enter a Start Time and End Time for that Flying Period. Select the Sortie Type and enter the Count. Modify the ASD, if required. Repeat, adding Flying Periods and Sorties until the Plan numbers equal (or approximate) the Calc numbers. TTP: Once you have a date completely planned, you can copy it to other dates by right-clicking on the date and selecting Copy Day. Then, select the days and/or dates you want to copy to and select Paste. Update Total Allocated Hours. To add or subtract Total Allocated Hours while executing the Flying Hour Plan, in the Overview page left-click in the bottom row labeled Hours. A new dialog opens and Total Allocated Hours may be overwritten. Clicking off the line re-calculates the monthly Contract hours in that dialog. Clicking Save prompts you to re-calculate the Plan in the Calendar. Copy Accounts. If you have multiple accounts to manage that are very similar in terms of no-fly days, ASDs, attrition, etc., instead of starting from scratch, you can copy an existing account and then make modifications to the new account. Once copied, the only things not modifiable are the account Start Date, End Date, Local/Zulu, and Location. To copy an account, select Flying Hours Tab, Overview page. Select the account, right-click and select Copy Account. Modify the Squadron, Period, BA, PEC, Name (mandatory), Version (mandatory), and MDS as desired. Click Save. Total hours can be modified by clicking on the Hours row in the Attrition/ASD gird after the account is copied. New Version of an Account. Using versions allows you to develop what if.. scenarios. For example, you might need to calculate the number of sorties required with different monthly ASDs. To make another version of an account, right-click on an account and select Create New Version. In the dialog, enter a designation (e.g., B or C) for this version. PEX will copy everything about the original account into the new version. From there, you can modify attrition, ASDs, budgeted hours, and/or planned sorties/hours. Only one version of an account is active at any time. Inactivating all versions of an account inactivates the overall account. When you are done tracking an account, inactivate it so it doesn't show on lists anymore. To Set a Version to Active. Go to Flying Hours tab > Overview click on the account to be set to active under the accounts header. When the \u2018Monthly\u2019 view appears check the \u2018Active Version\u2019 checkbox in the upper left corner. To Set a Version to Inactive. Go to Flying Hours tab > Overview click on the active account (shown in green) to be set to inactive under the accounts header. When the \u2018Monthly\u2019 view appears uncheck the \u2018Active Version\u2019 checkbox in the upper left corner. Delete a Version. From the \u2018Flying Hours\u2019 tab right click and select the \u2018Delete\u2019 button. This wil not delete the overall account, only that version of it. View an Inactivated Account. From the \u2018Flying Hours\u2019 tab click on the funnel icon at the upper right corner of the display and checkmark \u2018Show Inactive Accounts\u2019 and continue the selection process as normal. Delete an Account. To completely delete an account all flying hour versions created for the account to be must be deleted. !!! Note Once sorties have been created and logged against a particular flying hour account and version it is impossible to delete it. Single and Multi-Day Remarks. If desired, Single-Day Remark and Multi-Day Remarks can be set by right-clicking and selecting the appropriate command. These functions wil not work on dates in the past. Multi-Day Remarks are displayed on the Weekly view but not the Monthly. Background Colors. If desired, to highlight a particular day(s), right-click and select Background Color. This function wil not work on dates in the past. Starting Calendar Day. You can tell PEX what day of the week you want the weekly view to start on. For instance, if you want this view to display Monday as the first day of information, right-click on a Monday and select Starting Calendar Day. Flying Hours, Associate Units If your flying organization is an association of Active Duty (AD), National Guard (ANG), and/or Reserve (AFRC) units, this topic details how to setup the PEX Flying Hours module. Let\u2019s say the AD wing develops the overall flying plan for the base. They decide which days to fly and how many sorties to fly each day. After the sorties are flown, depending on whether the pilot and/or aircraft belonged to AD, ANG, or AFRC; the flying hours get charged to AD, ANG, or AFRC. If this is your situation, you need to setup an account for each MAJCOM (AD, ANG, and AFRC) plus an overall base (e.g., Langley AFB) account for them to feed into: 102 On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for the overall base (AD + ANG + AFRC). In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AD + ANG + AFRC. In this base account, identify the overall Expected Attrition, ASD, and monthly contract hours (AD + ANG + AFRC). On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the AD sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AD only. In this AD account, identify the monthly breakout of AD hours. (These are the flying hours that will feed ACC\u2019s Flying Hours Online (FHOL) application.) Adding more detail (Att% or ASD) to this account is optional. On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the ANG sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for ANG only. Adding more detail (monthly breakout of hours, Att%, or ASD) to this account is optional. On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the AFRC sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AFRC only. Adding more detail (monthly breakout of hours, Att%, or ASD) to this account is optional. On the Overview page, right-click on the AD account and select \u201cEdit.\u201d In the \u201cAlso Update\u201d list, select the overall base account created in Step 1. This will feed scheduled/actual sorties/hours from the AD account to the overall base account. Repeat Step 7 using the ANG and AFRC accounts. Have those accounts \u201cAlso Update\u201d the overall base account created in Step 1. In the PEX Mission Board > Tools > Pre-Mission Settings, Set the default Flying Plan to the overall base account created in Step 1. This will default all new sorties to the base flying hours account. After sorties are flown, decide whether they are to be charged to AD, ANG, or AFRC and select the appropriate account in the Mission Board, Sorties grid, Flying Plan column. Use the overall base account to monitor the overall progress of the geographic location and the associated accounts to monitor AD, ANG, or AFRC individually. Flying Hours, Monitor Execution First, pick the Flying Hours Account(s) you are interested in. On the Flying Hours tab > Overview page, click the Flying Hours Settings icon (funnel) at the top-right of the page. Make your selections and narrow down the list of Accounts to just the one(s) you are interested in. Overview Page View Target Hours for the current date View Actual Hours flown to date View Hours Remaining to date View a Progress bar comparing Target Hours to Actual Hours Daily Page (Single Account Only) This page provides a detailed listing of hours and sortie data about a single account. It includes every day in the plan and a running sum of each category. Right-click to export the data to Excel. The day is displayed in either Zulu or Local, depending on your selections when the flying hours account was created. To determine whether your day is displayed in Zulu or Local, return to the overview page, right-click on the account, select Edit and look at the bottom left corner of the Edit dialog. Graphs Page New Graphs page functionality includes: Opening the page in a new, separate window. Colors matched to MAJCOM Flying Hour Program standards. The ability to export the graph as a PDF or image file, image option formats being PNG or SVG. While both PNG and SVG support transparency (the ability to view background through the image), SVG can be scaled to any size. Five different graphs provide data about the flying plan Sorties, Hours (), Attrition, Average Sortie Duration, and Hours (). Attrition. The Attrition graph displays sortie (not hours) attrition. Hours (Line, not Bars). The Contract line on the Hours line graph resets to the Flown value at the end of each month. In other words, if you contracted for 350 hours for the month of October but flew 400, the October contract line would end at 350 but the November contract line would start at 400 hours. The Future Scheduled line on the Hours line graph takes attrition into account. In other words, the display assumes you will lose the specified percentage of the schedule. To attain your flying hour goal, you should schedule enough sorties so the Future Scheduled line ends at the same point as the Contract line. View Summary Data To view a monthly or weekly summary of the progress of your flying plan, go to either the Monthly or Weekly pages and click on the Summary link at the top right of the page. This will open the Summary dialog with data for the month of the date you had selected on the Monthly or Weekly page. The top half of the dialog breaks the month up by week. For each week, and for both Sorties and Hours, PEX displays the Contract, Plan, Sched, Actual and Delta hours for that week (or partial week.) The bottom half of the dialog has three date spans: The Plan through the end of last month The Plan for just this month The Plan through the end of this month. Each date span includes the same data as the top half of the page as well as showing Plan vs Actual for Att Rate, ASD, and Fly Days. Day-to-Day Use When you get so far ahead or behind on flying hours that you need to re-plan: create another version of the account. Do not create a new Account. In that new version, change your planning factors (Allocated Hours, ASD, attrition, no-fly days, surge days, etc.). Then select a date from which to reflow the hours, and recalculate the plan. If you then decide to implement the modified plan, select it as the \"Active Version\" on the Weekly view. By creating another version, you retain your original plan in case you need to reference it later.

If you incorrectly match a pair, to un-match them: From the Sortie Matches Tab or the Sortie Matches with Discrepancies Tab, Highlight the PEX/REMIS sortie pair. Click Hit the Unmatch button. Reconciliation, Edit PEX Data If you decide the information from REMIS is correct and the data in PEX needs to be updated: Navigate to Matches with Discrepancies page On the PEX sortie row, select the field to be edited by clicking on it. The following PEX fields are editable: MDS, Tail #, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Landing Date/Time, Sorties Flown, Total Landing and Total Ful Stops. Click off the line to save the changes. Once the fields of MDS, Tail Number, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Land Date/Time, Sorties Flown, Total Landings and Total Full Stops are exactly the same, the sortie pair will move to the Sortie Matches tab. FY Progress from REMIS Units not using PEX for scheduling can still view the progress of their flying plan from REMIS: follow setup and import procedures listed above Navigate to the Scheduling > Flying Hours > REMIS > FY Progress page Select the appropriate MDS Select the Fiscal Year you wish to view. Click the Go! button. To view FY sorties flown, select the Sorties Flown radio button. To view FY hours flown, select the Hours Flown radio button. Flying Schedule \u00b6 FS - Setup Introduction The Flying Schedule - Setup page allows you to establish requirements for Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, Post-Sortie Crew Rest, and Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule by squadron, MDS, and Crew Position. Setup Pre-Sortie Crew Rest Right-click in the grid and select Add. Select the MDS, the Crew Position (select the letter indicator in the column of the crew position code that your activity uses. For example, for an F-16 Pilot, select MDS of F-16C and P in the D2 Column. (The D columns are the five Sortie Duty Position characters.) Under Pre Crew Rest, enter the number of hours required for Pre-Sortie Crew Rest and whether you want the crew rest added automatically when the person is scheduled on the first sortie of the day. Setup Post-Sortie Crew Rest On the same line as Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, under Post Crew Rest, enter the number of hours required for Post-Sortie Crew Rest, if any. This crew rest will not add automatically. Setup Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule Click the Alternative Crew Rest checkbox. This is all you need to do. This is an alternative to only the Post-Sortie Crew Rest. It does not affect the Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, already established. The implementation is automatic when: The sortie duration exceeds 16.0 hours. The Mission Status - TDY checkbox is checked for the sortie Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule commitments have a duration of 1/3 of the sortie duration, not to exceed 96 hours. The generated commitment begins one minute after Scheduled Post Sortie End to prevent display of conflicts between the Post Sortie End and the Post Crew Rest Start. The commitment\u2019s start and end times are adjusted when the schedule is changed, as wel as when Actual times are entered. Once generated, the commitment is not deleted if the duration drops below 16.1 flying hours. The scheduler must remove personnel from the sortie or use the crew details dialog to delete post crew rest commitments. Duration of Post-Mission Crew Rest is calculated in hours and rounded to the tenths, e.g., a 26-hour sortie generates an 8.7 hour commitment. To use this feature for off-station missions, ensure that schedulers enter the mission as a single sortie, where the sortie takeoff time is the takeoff time of the first off-station mission and the sortie land time is the land time of the last off-station mission. FS - Sorties Concept. This page is used to build sorties. It is not used to crew those sorties or to add loads/weapons to those sorties. If you are a flight scheduler, we recommend you do not use this Sorties page. Instead, use the WinPEX-only Mission Board to build your sorties. Then, come back to the Flying Schedule module to crew the sorties and to add loads/weapons. The Mission Board has much more sortie building functionality than this Sorties page. If for some reason, the Mission Board is not available to you, the following instructions explain how to use the less functional Sorties page. Setup the Sorties page First, hide all the columns that aren\u2019t required: right-click in the header row just below the Date to invoke a context menu, select Grid Settings. At least one mission must be available to invoke the context menu. Click the buttons in the \u201ceye\u201d column that are required, un-check those not required. The Squadrons/Calendar selection grid on left may be hidden by clicking the left-pointing arrow next to \u201cSquadrons\u201d, affording a full Sorties Board view. Second, configure column order: click-and-drag the column header and drop to desired placement. Third, and importantly, save these changes by right-click select Save Settings. Click Settings> User Preferences. Show cancelled sorties, when checked, the sortie grid displays cancelled missions. These sorties are designated with a strike-through. Click Settings> Squadron Preferences. These apply to all users in the squadron. Create mission as RPA mission, when checked, all missions for that squadron are created as RPA missions and are configurable on the RPA schedule. !!! Note RPA missions are not displayed on the Crew page and therefore cannot be crewed in Flying Schedule module. You must use the RPA Schedule module to add crew. Difference between a Mission and a Sortie A mission consists of one or more sorties. A mission always has at least one sortie. A mission could be a trip with multiple segments (sorties). A mission could also be a formation, where all the sorties belong together. Add a single sortie Click Add Mission and a new line will be generated to enter sortie data. Fill in as many fields as possible. Come back later and fill in the remaining fields as the data is known. Add a formation Click Add Formation to open a dialog where formation information can be added, previewed and edited prior to adding it to the schedule. The data entered will display for all sorties in that formation. Fill in as many fields as possible. Come back later and fill in the remaining fields as the data is known. Add a sortie to an existing mission or formation Click on the mission or formation. Click Add Mission> Add Sortie to Msn/Formation. This adds a sortie to an existing mission or formation. If a mission, the new sortie\u2019s takeoff time wil be one minute after the previous sortie\u2019s land time. If a formation, the new sortie will assume the settings of the formation\u2019s existing sorties. Copy an existing mission to another day Multiple missions may be duplicated to multiple days within a user-selected period of time. To replicate, select Replicate Mission. When the dialog opens, select a squadron and date. When the missions appear, select the source mission or missions. Select which data is to be replicated and the date (or dates) for your target missions. You can choose to replicate missions by days of the week within a date span, and by specific dates. Preview your missions with the Add to Preview button. In Preview, mission numbers and start date/time may be edited. Missions can be removed from preview if no longer desired. Click OK to create the mission(s) and close the dialog, Cancel to abort, or Apply to create the mission(s) and keep the dialog open. Enter actual takeoff and land times Double-clicking in the Actual Takeoff and Land Time fields fills them in with current time. To set a different time, select Actions> Adjust Actuals. If you\u2019re entering actual times from a previous day, you must select to show both the actual date and time columns. When you adjust actual, you have to set both the date and time. Enter the takeoff time first then the land time. What\u2019s the difference between deleting a mission and cancelling it? Deleting missions removes them from PEX. Cancelling missions leaves them in PEX but removes all the associated personnel and location commitments. Before going firm on a schedule, delete the mission. After going firm, cancel the mission so it can be tracked historically. Delete missions Delete Mission allows you to delete missions individually or multiple missions simultaneously. To delete a single mission, highlight the mission, right-click and select Delete Mission. For multiple missions, a dialog appears allowing you to select missions within a specified date range. Missions created from the replicate process display \"Source Mission\" information. Missions that were created from scratch will not show any source mission information. Sorties can be deleted from a mission and, if no sorties remain, the mission will be deleted. Missions committed (firm) in the Mission Board cannot be deleted here. Cancel missions From Actions drop-down, Cancel Mission and Cancel Sortie allow you to cancel missions or sorties. To see canceled sorties, click Settings (gear icon), User Preferences, Show cancelled sorties; the cancelled sortie(s) will display with strike-through. To uncancel a sortie, highlight the sortie, right-click and select Uncancel Sortie. Committed (firm) Missions can be canceled but not deleted. If a committed mission with multiple sorties is cancelled, sorties may be uncanceled individually. An entire mission cannot be uncanceled. Use all the different page controls Squadrons Selects which squadrons\u2019 missions/sorties are displayed. Select any combination of squadrons by holding the Ctrl key while clicking. !!! Note if two or more squadrons are selected for display, Add Mission and Delete Mission are disabled. Calendar Zulu: When selected, the sortie times are based on Zulu. Also, it allows editing dates and times in Zulu but not Local. Local: When selected, the sortie times are based on Local. Also, it allows editing dates and times in Local but not Zulu. !!! Note Local date is determined by the user's location set in the Users & Permissions module. Start/End Date/Time: Defines the time span in which to display missions/sorties. Load Sorties: Refreshes the sortie display after changing squadron or dates. Page refresh: (counter-clockwise-open-arrows) Refreshes the page. Pin page (thumbtack icon): Any of the four Flying Schedule pages (Sorties, Crew, Loads, or Setup) may be \u201cpinned\u2019 to open first. This is a user preference. Date Display: Displays date or date span as selected in the Calendar control, in both normal and Julian formats. Arrow keys allow movement of the date or, if selected, a date span. If a date span is displayed, the span retains the selected number of days. Legend: Displays a legend describing the color lines used to detail sorties. FS - Crew Concept. The main purpose of the Crew tab is to schedule people onto sorties. Use the Mission Board to build the sorties, then come here to crew the sorties. A secondary purpose is to schedule people for non-sortie duties, such as meetings and training. Setup the Crew tab Set either a Five-Day or One-Day View. To switch to a One-Day View, right-click on the desired day below any existing sorties (in blank area) to invoke Expand Day and click it. To toggle back to Five-Day, right-click and click Collapse Day. Choose which Sortie data to display by clicking the Page Settings icon at top-right (white box with green arrow). Go to Setup> Five-Day View. The Five Day View Settings dialog will open. Select either 1 or 2 Row option, then drag/drop your desired Sortie data columns into Table Columns and order them by drag-and-drop. Click OK. The One-Day View is configured separately using the same procedure. Choose which Commitment Types to show below the Sorties. This is done from the same Five-Day or One-Day View Settings dialog launched from Page Settings. Simply check desired \u201cMultiple Commitment Types Shown\u201d and \u201cSingle Commitment Type Shown\u201d. Most units select Leave/TDY for the Single Commitment Type in order to break out these long-term commitments from the daily meetings and training. Click OK. !!! Note We recommend not selecting the Mission and Sortie commitment types because they already display above in the Sortie list. Display a Crew list by selecting an existing personnel filter or creating a new one. Create a new filter by clicking the \u201cfunnel\u201d icon, upper-left in the Crew grid. Clear the filter by clicking the red X. !!! Caution When using the Flying Schedule Crew tab to schedule personnel onto sorties, you wil experience faster performance by filtering the Crew List to as few people as possible. With a Crew List of about 30 people you will experience satisfactory speed. With a Crew List of over 200 people it will take three to four times longer to crew a sortie. If you experience performance outside these parameters, please contact the PEX Help Desk. Configure the Crew List to show or hide Availability, Squadron, Stan Eval, and/or RAP: From the Page Settings icon select Setup, then check/un-check from the menu (below Five-Day and One-Day options). !!! Note Hiding the Stan Eval and RAP columns will increase the speed of this page. Pick the sorties to work on You can see only one squadron\u2019s sorties at a time. You can see people from multiple squadrons in the Crew List area but in the Sorties area, it\u2019s one squadron at a time. Use the squadron selector above the Crew List to pick the squadron sorties you want to see. Next, select either Z or L, depending on whether you normal y schedule in Zulu or Local. Finally, select the date that you want your five-day view to start on. Schedule crew members onto sorties Click on the \u201cCheck Schedule Report\u201d icon at the top of the Crew List (green checkmark). This report identifies scheduling priorities for the selected time frame. Move the report to another monitor or print it. The report includes data for all the personnel in the Crew List. Click on a sortie to be crewed. Notice the crew list now displays information about each person. Referring to the legend, you can tell if the person is overdue for training, on DNIF, on a Restriction, on Supervised Status, already committed, in the zone for an evaluation, and/or their RAP count. Using the information from the Check Schedule report for priorities, schedule a person onto the sortie by drag-and-drop from the Crew List to the Sortie. When your sorties are all crewed, run the Check Schedule report again to see any missed priorities. To remove someone from a sortie, click on the name and drag it back to the Crew List. You can also drag a person from one sortie to another. You cannot drag a person from a sortie to a commitment below or from a commitment to a sortie. !!! Note When a person is selected in the Crew List, the name is highlighted everywhere it appears. This wil help you view a person\u2019s weekly schedule at a glance. This is useful for spotting tight turn times between finishing night duty and starting morning duty. !!! Note If a person is dragged onto a sortie that creates a conflict with another commitment, a Conflict Dialog will display. This dialog will enable you to \u201cSchedule\u201d the person anyway or to \u201cCancel,\u201d which does not put the person on the sortie. Enter flight authorization and 781 data for the crew Once the crew is scheduled, right-click on the sortie and select Crew Details. This Crew Details dialog allows you to order the crew by drag-and-drop. It is also the place to fill in the details of Duty Position, Crew Codes, etc. that populate the flight authorization and AFTO 781. The crew member at the top of the list is considered the Aircraft Commander and will be able to sign off the PEX AFTO 781 Pilot review. To designate the aircraft commander formally for the AF Form4327a, set the first Crew Code to \u201cA\u201d. Hide Tail Numbers for No-Go personnel In the Mission Board> Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences, check the Auto No-Go box. This automatically checks the manual No-Go box for anyone added to a sortie. When the manual No-Go box is checked for any person on the crew, the sortie\u2019s tail number will not be visible to anyone on the crew on the Mission Board, Squadron Daily Schedule, or any Scheduling report. Back on the Crew tab, once someone verifies a crewmember is good to go, go to the Crew Details dialog and manually uncheck the No-Go box. Once all crew members on the sortie are unchecked, the tail number will display. !!! Note This manual checkbox is not tied at all to the automatic Go/No-Go page in PEX. Add Crew Rest In the Crew Details dialog, if the Crew Rest and Post Crew Rest columns are not visible, right-click and select Grid Settings. Check the box next to them and click OK. You can setup PEX to auto-add Pre-Sortie Crew Rest. This Crew Details dialog is where you can manually add Post-Sortie Crew Rest. !!! Note To add Post-Sortie Crew Rest automatically using the 1-to-3 rule, refer to the instructions at PEX Help> Scheduling> Flying Schedule \u2013 Setup> \u201csetup Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule\u201d. Build and use Crew Templates A Crew Template is a grouping of crew positions, e.g., two pilots, one navigator, two loadmasters (P, P, N, L, L). To create a Crew Template, right-click on a sortie which has been crewed with the desired crew makeup. Right-click and select Save As: Crew Template. Provide the template a Name, e.g., \u201cOverwater Nav Crew.\u201d Description is optional. To apply a Template to a Sortie, select the Crew Set tab at lower-left, and drag/drop the Crew Template Name to the sortie. To view the crew positions on a Crew Template, click the \u201c+\u201d icon. To fil the template with actual people, use the Crew tab and drag/drop. Build and use Hard Crews (Crew Set) A Crew Set is a group of specific people (not crew positions). To create a Crew Set, right-click on a sortie which has been crewed and select Save As: Crew Set. Provide the crew set a Name, e.g., \u201cR-21\u201d. Description is optional. To schedule a hard crew to a sortie, select the Crew Set tab at lower-left, and drag/drop the Crew Set Name to the sortie. To view people on a Crew Set, click the \u201c+\u201d icon. Schedule ground commitments from here To add a new commitment. While holding down the Ctrl key, drag a person from the Crew List to the Commitment area at lower-right to the desired day. Release the mouse button while still holding the Ctrl key. A Commitment dialog for the person wil appear. Enter the commitment data, click off the row to save, and close the dialog. The commitment will appear on the Crew tab. If it does not, you have probably chosen to not see this type of commitment. To make it show up, go to Page Settings (upper-right icon) and check the desired \u201cMultiple Commitment Types Shown\u201d. To add a person to an existing commitment. Drag-and-drop the person from the Crew List onto the commitment. You can build shell commitments, such as Alert, Duty Officer, or SOF on the Commitments Board, then use the Crew tab to fil the commitments.- To remove a person from a commitment. Drag-and-drop the person\u2019s name from the commitment back to the Crew List. When you drag the last person off a commitment, you wil be asked if you want the entire commitment deleted. You may want to leave the commitment in place to be filled by someone else later. Schedule an evaluation. The person must have an open evaluation in Stan Eval Management and be scheduled on a sortie. Right-click on the sortie and, in the context menu, click Crew Details. On the evaluatee's details row, click on the field in the Evaluation column and view all open evaluations for that person. Select the desired evaluation and click OK. The scheduled evaluation now appears in Stan Eval Management > Eval Details and the evaluatee's My Page under the Stan/Eval section. FS - Loads Concept. The purpose of the Loads page is to schedule loads (weapons, ammunition, chaff, flares, cargo, etc.) on the sortie. The sorties are created in the Mission Board, then come here to schedule the loads on those sorties. Loads can be assigned individually to a sortie or as part of a set (SCL \u2013 Standard Configuration Load). Setup the Loads tab There is no setup to be done on the Loads tab itself. Go to another module, the Weapons module, to identify your MDS stations, load items, and build your SCLs. Assign an individual load item to a sortie In the grid on the left, select the Loads tab (at the bottom of the grid.) Select a Category of load. Then, click on the sortie you wish to assign the load. At the bottom, the Stations Grid will populate with available stations for the MDS assigned the sortie. Finally, click the desired Load Item, and drag it to the desired station (not to the upper sorties area). Assign an SCL to a sortie In the grid on the left, select the SCLs tab (at the bottom of the grid.) (!!! Note ensure \u201cReq SCL\u201d is selected to display in the Sortie column header, configured from Crew page, Page Settings, Five-Day and/or One day View.) Click the desired SCL and drag it to the target Sortie (not to the bottom Stations area). The SCL name will display in the \u201cReq SCL\u201d column on the sortie grid. (!!! Note When building SCLs in the Weapons module, we recommend, in addition to listing every named station on the aircraft, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares; if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them. Auto-build an SCL number from individual load items Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which in PEX is called Load Code. For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading of 2500 rounds of code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. To use Load Codes in PEX, do the following: Use only a single station on the sortie. Call it whatever you like, \u201cSortie\u201d would be fine. Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them. PEX will generate the Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board. Page Controls Squadron: Selects which squadron's missions/sorties and ground commitments are displayed. MDS: Selects which sorties, by MDS, are displayed. Only sorties that are assigned this MDS will display so if you have sorties that do not have an MDS assigned they will not show up or if you have sorties with a different MDS assigned, you wil need to change the MDS selection to view them. Local/Zulu: Selects whether the missions/sorties displayed for a given date are for that local date or Zulu date. Local date is determined by the user's location set in the Users & Permissions module. Calendar Control: The double arrows move the display five days at a time. The single arrow moves the display one day at a time. The calendar icon brings up a control that will allow you to select any date. Last Updated Time: The last time sortie data was updated. Formation Replication: This is the icon with the capital F located at the top right of the loads grid. When selected it has a down arrow beside it to indicate activation. When activated, any changes made to lead\u2019s load/SCL will be replicated to the wingmen in the formation. Celestial Data: Sunrise/Sunset, Moonrise/Moonset, and Percent Moon Illumination are calculated based on the user's location's latitude/longitude and date. Right-Click on a Sortie Functions: Edit Munition Proj #: When selected, a dialog opens allowing you to select a Munitions Project Number for the sortie. Clear All Load Items: When selected, clears all loads from the sortie. Expand Day: Right-click on a day when in Five-Day view, select Expand Day and it expands the display to show the One-Day View. Collapse Day: Right-click on a day when in One-Day view, select Collapse Day and it collapses the display to show the Five-Day View. Right-Click on a Station Functions: Delete Load Item: When selected, the load item wil be deleted. Add Station: When selected, adds a new station to the end of your list of stations cal ed New Station. You can rename the station and otherwise use it as you would any other station. This allows you to account for a tail number that has an extra station. Delete Station: When selected, deletes the station you right clicked in, along with any loads on the station. Clear Station Load Items: When selected, all load items on the station wil be deleted. FS - ICBM Schedule Concept. The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Schedule page is used to develop an alert schedule for up to two months. These alerts take place at various locations. Each alert mission comprises three phases: Alert, Travel (leaving from the location), and Off Days. The length of each phase is 24 hours but can be modified. What logic does PEX use to build the alert schedule? PEX will auto-schedule personnel onto alert missions using the following rules: The alert schedule can be generated for 62 days max The alert is manned with an MCCC (Mission Commander). Additional crew members can be MCCCs or DMCCCs (Deputy Mission Commanders) If you check the box Create Schedule with Incomplete Manning (recommended) and an MCCC is not available, PEX will build the schedule without an MCCC If you don\u2019t check the box Create Schedule with Incomplete Manning and an MCCC is not available, PEX wil not build the schedule If a person\u2019s crew position is not MCCC or DMCCC, the person wil not be scheduled If a person's Max Alerts per Month = 0, the person wil not be scheduled If a person has another commitment on a day, the person wil not be scheduled If the alert location requires a specific certification, the crew must have that certification with a status of \"Is Certified\" A person cannot be scheduled for more than his/her established Max Alerts per Month If a person's Max Alerts per Month is equal to 1 or 2, that person is not scheduled for an Alert sortie that falls on Saturday or Sunday. Travel and Off Days can fall on the weekend but not the Alert. People with the same crew number sit alert together, when able If a location specifies a Flight, crew from that flight sit alert together, when able Available personnel are randomized, so the A\u2019s don't always end up manning the 1st of the month Available personnel are weighted, so those who got fewer alerts \"last period\" have a greater probability of getting an alert this period Set this up Maintenance> Aircraft: Ensure an MDS of LGM-30G is listed Setup> Squadrons: Ensure LGM-30G is selected for Show in Dropdown Setup> Validation> expand Scheduling> expand Mission Board> click on Sortie Type. Right-click Add new Sortie Types: Alert, Off, and Travel. See figure below for example: Setup> Personnel> Setup tab> select Crew Number. On the Listings grid, right click and select Add.

Right-click, select ADD, and enter all your silo location names, e.g., \u201cA10_1010_MALM\u201d. Ops> Letter of X. Assign your personnel their certifications and set status to \u201cis certified\u201d. If required for a certain alert location, PEX will look for these certifications when the schedule is generated. In WinPEX (not ePEX)> Scheduling> Mission Board> Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Add Sortie Tab> Set MDS to LGM-30G. Switch to the Add Sortie Events tab. Set the T/O Location to PEX and your base location (not a silo location). Select OK to save the pre-mission settings. all ICBM schedulers should perform this user preference step. Generate the alert schedule Navigate to Scheduling> Flying Schedule> Sorties tab. Click the ICBM Schedule icon in the top Tool bar. The ICBM Auto Schedule dialog opens. Fill in the data similar to the following figure: Click Create Schedule. When complete a log file is generated. Save this slog file. Close the dialog. Once generated, it should look similar to: Pull someone off alert On the Flying Schedule> Crew tab, drag the name off the mission, all three phases (Alert, Travel, and Off). Replace with another name. Delete a mission From the Flying Schedule> Sortie tab, use the Delete Mission Option. Deleting the alert mission(s), deletes all three phases. FS - DMO Concept. The PEX Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) module allows geographically separated PEX units to share scheduling information for the purpose of maximizing training. Local PEX units register with their MAJCOM and this registration allows the local units to see the PEX flying/simulator schedules of other registered units. After seeing their schedules, you can use PEX to send out support requests. Register my squadron Navigate to Setup > Squadrons > MAJCOM Registration tab Click the Register Squadron button In the Register Squadron with MAJCOM dialog, from Info Type drop-down select Scheduling From the squadron drop-down select the squadron to register Enter POC information as required. If your squadron already has POC information entered in the PEX Squadrons module, this information wil be pre-populated here. If the POC for DMO will be different from the one listed, overwrite the data. This will not override the POC information from the squadron page; it will be additional just for DMO. Enter the MAJCOM Name. MAJCOM name wil be pre-populated with the value from the Squadrons module. You can overwrite the information as required. To register a squadron with more than one MAJCOM DMO system, just repeat the process using a different MAJCOM name and MAJCOM URL. The MAJCOM URL wil be sent to you; once you have it, copy/paste into the space provided. Click Save. Clicking Save and New saves the information and clears the form to allow another entry. Clicking \u201cCancel\u201d closes the dialog and no information is saved. Once your squadron is registered, the squadron\u2019s status at MAJCOM wil be \u201cwaiting for approval.\u201d Your MAJCOM will then approve your registration. Syncing of scheduling data is automatic at pre-determined intervals or can be done manually via the Sync to MAJCOM button in the Flying Scheduling > Sorties tab. There is no notification to you that your MAJCOM status has changed. Simply revisit the page or contact your MAJCOM by email or phone if you have any questions. We\u2019re registered. How do we see another unit\u2019s schedule Go to scheduling > Flying schedule > MAJCOM schedule One time, setup your view. Right-click > Grid Settings and select to view DMO Support Requests. Select the eyeball for other columns you want to see and the padlock if you want that column locked to the left side of the grid. Select the registered MAJCOM you wish to view Set the date range you want to view. The filter selections display items that are scheduled. E.g., if you set a date range and don\u2019t see MC-130P in the MDS list, it means none are scheduled for the selected dates. You could load the schedule at this time, but you\u2019ll get all missions/sorties for all registered squadrons. This may be too large a list to be of practical use. Pare it down by using the filter selection controls which will narrow your choices as you select each section. The list of squadrons will depend on the MDSs selected. The list of sortie types wil depend on the squadrons selected. You can Load Sorties any time after you\u2019ve set a date range. After you load the schedule, when you click on a sortie, the support request wil populate under the Msn Support Request at the bottom of page. The POC Information will also display. You can send a request email directly to the POC.

Long Range Schedule Setup The Long Range Schedule (LRS) displays scheduling data in customized views. These data pul from their respective modules. Commitment Types. Your full-range of Commitment Types (Duty, TDY, etc.) Shift Types. Your full-range of Shift Types (AM, PM, etc.) Personnel filters. Letter of X Certifications. Personnel > Teams. There are two drop-down controls on the page. In the Personnel filter drop-down, select \u201c(None)\u201d. In the Squadron drop-down, select your squadron. You should see a list of people in your squadron and their commitments. Views Views allow you to look at different groups of people (e.g., Pilots, Loadmasters, A Flight, B Flight, Team Alpha, or Team Bravo) and for each group, a different set of mission requirements (Shifts, Certifications, and/or Commitments), and a different set of mission requirement warning flags for each. To setup a view: Decide on a group of people to manage, for example \u201cA Flight.\u201d Use the Personnel Filter selector to pick your A Flight filter. Use drag-and-drop to order personnel. Click the Totals Displayed button. In the dialog, click the arrowheads to expand all the entries. For Shifts, select the Letter of X certifications (e.g., Supervisor) you need to monitor for minimum manning. For example, if you need at least two Supervisors per Shift. For Commitments, select the Commitment Types (e.g., Leave) you need to monitor for maximum allowable. For example, if you want no more than 5 people on leave per day. Warning Flags Warning Flags button. Click Yes to the Confirm dialog about \u201c\u2026 no views created.\u201d For Shifts: In the header, where the Shift name is, enter the minimum number of people needed on the shift overall. Under the Shift name, for each certification, enter the minimum number of people, with that certification, needed on the shift. !!! Note Even though all the certifications show up, you only need to enter minimum values for the certifications in view (on the screen behind the dialog.) For Commitments, under the Team name, for each Commitment Type, enter the maximum number of people per day desired. !!! Note Even though all the commitment types show up, you only need to enter maximum values for the commitment types in view (on the screen behind the dialog.) At top-left, click View > Add. Type in the name of this View, e.g., \u201cA Flight\u201d and click OK. Notice the View shows up as a button at the bottom of the screen. From here on, when you want to see this view, click the button. !!! NOTE Views are by-person. If someone else in your unit needs the same view, they need to create it individually \u2013 they cannot be shared. Repeat these steps for additional Views, e.g., \u201cB Flight\u201d. Settings Click the Settings button. These settings are not by View; they are by-page. Each of your Views will use these settings. Number of operators per page. Computer performance permitting, select a high number (e.g., 999) that captures all your personnel. Show commitment text. In the LRS schedule blocks for each person/day, PEX wil show the first three characters of the Commitment Name if you check this box. Edit or delete a View. To edit a view: select it, make the changes, and click View > Save. To delete it: select it and click View > Delete. Use the Long Range Schedule Use the Long Range Schedule to: Check for scheduling issues, undermanned shifts, and/or excessive commitments. Add, edit, and delete personnel commitments. Email PDF schedules to your personnel. Manage shift patterns, and to add or remove people from shifts. You cannot create Shifts or Shift Templates from the LRS module. Those must be managed in the Shift Schedule module. The instructions below apply to a View (a grouping of people). If you manage multiple Views (groups of people), accomplish the steps below for each View. Check for scheduling issues In the calendar area, scroll down and look for any person/date blocks that have a blue triangle at top-right or a red triangle at bottom-right. Blue triangle indicates multiple commitments are scheduled on that day and one needs to be identified as the primary commitment. Click on the person/date block to open the Commitments dialog. Click on the person\u2019s name to see that person\u2019s commitments that day. !!! NOTE The red X in the Conflict column simply means the Reviewed checkbox is not checked. It does not mean there is or is not a conflict. In the Display column, pick the main commitment for the day. This one shows on the calendar and is the one that counts in the totals below. In the Reviewed column, check the box and click OK. Notice in the person/date block, the main commitment is displayed and the blue triangle is gone (indicating you\u2019ve reviewed this block). Red Triangle indicates conflicting commitments. Click on the person/date block to open the Commitments dialog. Click on the person\u2019s name to see that person\u2019s commitments that day. Edit the commitments to eliminate the conflict or accept the conflict. Check for undermanned shifts In the bottom section of the screen, under Shift Types, look for any blocks in red. This is where you have either a Shift undermanned and/or a specific certification on a Shift undermanned. Check for excessive commitments In the bottom section of the screen, under Teams, look for any blocks in red. This is where you have too many people on that Commitment Type that day. Check personnel by Qualifications & Certifications This displays individuals' MDS/CP qualifications and LoX Certifications. At top-left, directly below View, click the > icon. This opens the Quals & Certs grid. Drag the gray vertical bar to the right to expand the grid area. You should see a blank panel with \"Select operator(s) to view quals and certs.\" Populate the Quals & Certs grid. In the Operators list area, check the individual personnel checkboxes, or right-click and click Select All Operators. In the Quals & Certs grid, right-click > Grid Settings to select which columns to view. Add a commitment Normally, commitments are managed in the Commitments Board module due to its greater functionality. However, to enter commitments directly from the LRS, the following is the best way: On the person/date block, right-click and select Add Commitment Notice the date and person are already filled in. Enter the remaining data and click Save and Close. Edit a Commitment Click on a person\u2019s commitment block to open the dialog showing all commitments for that person on that date. Highlight the Commitment and click Edit Commitment. Make the change and click Save. !!! NOTE You cannot edit sorties or shifts from the LRS. Edit those in the Flying Schedule and Shift Schedule modules. See all commitment details for a single day Click on the date at the top of the column. A dialog displays the personnel. Right-click and select Expand All. Email the schedule to people Click the Email icon Pick the date range for the schedule you want to send n addition to the schedule (Commitments), select which other sections to include Pick the personnel you want the email to go out to Click Edit Remarks and enter any comments you want to go out Click View PDF to see what the report wil look like In the Email area, type in your email address and click the Send Email button. Each person will get an individual email with only their report. The Cc person will get copies of all the individual emails, not a single email with a consolidated report. How do I build recurring shift patterns using the LRS? A recurring shift pattern is something like four days on, two days off, etc. You can build a shift pattern from the LRS module or the Shift Schedule module. To build one from the LRS, click the Shifts icon and Manage Shift Patterns command. For detailed instructions, see Managing Your Shifts. Mission Board \u00b6 Setup Concept. The Mission Board (MB) is used to build a flying schedule. Individual missions are created as either single sorties, formations, or trips. Airspace sortie events are added here. Once the missions are created in the MB, Crew and Loads are scheduled to those missions in the Flying Schedule module. You can tailor the MB to your flying mission. How do I setup the MB? following are the steps needed to configure the MB for your unique flight scheduling operation. However, you may not need to do them if someone in your office has created a MB template. To find out, go to MB> Tools> Template Manager and see if your office has a template listed. It would normally be named something like \u201c757TS Flight Scheduling\u201d. If so, go ahead and Open it, close the MB, and come back to the MB. If you applied a template, you should skip the steps below. Pick your View, Fighter or Standard. There are two available views. The Standard View (S icon below the menu bar) is for missions requiring a large amount of detailed information regarding sorties, events, and timing. This \u201cS\u201d view is normally used by Airlift, Bombers, Tankers, and other large aircraft. The Fighter View (F icon below the menu bar) is normally used by Fighters and Trainer aircraft. Pick your columns. Go to View> Hide/Unhide Columns and select the columns to display (you need to have a least one selection in each list). Order and size your columns. Drag-and-drop the columns to the order you want by double left clicking on them, holding the column header, and dragging it to the proper location. Size the column by left clicking and holding on the right edge of the column and drag it either right or left to size it appropriately. Set your Add Sortie preferences. Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Add Sortie tab. Select the MDS and Flying Plan to default when you add a sortie. Set your Add Sortie Event preferences. Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Add Sortie Events tab. Select the default takeoff and land locations, crew show time, crew brief time, and crew post-sortie end time. Post-sortie end time is how much time you want to all ow the crew after they land to complete paperwork before you schedule them for something else. Change Takeoff Time preference. Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Change Takeoff Time tab. Tell PEX what to do when you change the takeoff time. We recommend you select Changes Show and Brief Dates/Times by Offset. Set MB User Options. Go to Tools> Options. Set the Location Source to PEX If your part-time personnel use the PEX Availability inputs, enable the Availability selection Select Sorties by Takeoff Date to exclude sorties that took off yesterday but land today Choose whether to see Cancelled Missions/Sorties If you schedule traditional formations (all sorties on one flight plan), check the box for Auto Replicate Formation Data Set MB Squadron Options Airspace Fighters and Trainers. If your sorties typically go to one airspace per sortie, pick \u201cAirspace\u201d once. Leave the others blank. If your sorties go to two airspaces per sortie, like a MOA and an AR Track, pick Airspace twice. And so on, up to five. Airlift, Bombers, Tankers, etc. Leave Blank. Use Sortie Event Sets instead. Adjust your columns in the Sorties grid to account for these new columns. Actual Takeoff and Land Time Deviations. The MB will highlight actual takeoff and land times outside the minutes you set here. PFPS. Leave blank. Supervisor Types. You can schedule up to three types of supervisors from the MB. Pick the three types here. RPA Unit. Select the box for \u201cCreate MSN as RPA MSN\u201d. This sets different logic on the missions add and allows the use of the RPA Scheduler module. Auto No-Go. The MB includes a manual No-Go process, not linked to the Go/No-Go module in PEX. Enable Auto No-Go to mark all your people as No-Go on the MB until you manually check them as Go. This feature is used in our tail number denial process. Auto Sortie Numbering. The \u201cEnable Auto Sortie #/Line #\u201d adds a sortie number and line number to each sortie. Enter the starting Line Number. When you add sorties, PEX wil number them for you. Change Notifications. The \u201cSet Change Notifications\u201d button allows you to select which fields trigger change notification actions. Save your setup as a template for others. To save others in your office the time of setting up their MBs from scratch and to have a standardized view across the office, save your MB as a template. To do so, go to Tools> Template Manager and select Save As. Give the template a name such as \u201c757TS Flight Scheduling.\u201d Build Sorties What\u2019s the difference between a Mission and a Sortie? In PEX, sorties belong to a mission. A mission could have just one sortie, plain and simple, think bombers and tankers. Alternatively, a mission could include multiple sorties, a trip, an aircraft and crew that fly multiple sorties, think airlift. A mission could also be comprised or formation sorties, think fighters and trainers. How do I build a single-sortie mission? Click the \"+ M\" icon on the menu bar. A new line will be generated in the Mission and Sorties grids. In the Mission grid, enter a Mission Number. In the Sorties grid, enter your sortie data. The Sortie times will drive the Mission Times. How do I build a trip mission? Go to Tools> Options and turn off Sorties by Takeoff Date. If you don\u2019t do this, when you add a sortie on a different day, the sortie will \u201cdisappear\u201d to its assigned takeoff date. To build a mission with multiple legs, start by adding a mission with a single sortie as described above. Once the mission is added and the data is added for the first sortie, right-click on that sortie and select Add Sortie to Mission. Once this is done a sortie wil be added with the takeoff time being one minute after the land time of the previous sortie. Also, the takeoff location be set to the land location of the previous sortie. Edit the second sortie data as necessary. To add another sortie, just repeat the process. How do I build a formation mission? Click the \"+ F\" icon on the menu bar. Once you get the Add Formation dialog, enter your data. A field marked with an asterisk \u201c*\u201d is mandatory. The dialog is divided into three areas: Basic Sortie Data, Airspace, and View. The first two areas are self-explanatory. The View grid is useful for adding additional formation data. The crew members and call signs can be entered on \u201cSummary/Crewmembers\u201d page. By clicking on the \u201cOther Formation Data\u201d you can enter other data pertaining to the formation. Once you complete the dialog data entry, click OK to add the formation to the MB. How can I break up a 4-ship into two 2-ships (or vice versa)? Right-click on a sortie and select Move Selected Sortie to Formation. \u201cNew\u201d wil create a new formation. The sortie wil keep the line # and the tail number when moved. How do I copy a sortie, a formation, an entire day, or an entire week? You can replicate a mission or multiple missions to different days using the Replicate Mission(s) function. To replicate a mission, right-click in the Missions grid and select Replicate Mission(s). A dialog will appear that will allow you to select a date range to choose which missions you want to replicate (use the CTRL key to multi-select). Then choose what data you want to replicate. Finally, you can select a date range and add the missions by the day of the week or just a day. Once the missions and dates are selected, click Apply or OK. If you click Apply, the dialog will remain open for more replication. How do I delete a single sortie? Right-click delete. The last sortie in a mission wil not delete. You need to delete the mission in this case. How do I delete a mission? Show the Mission grid if it\u2019s hidden (the M icon with a red slash). To delete a single mission, highlight the mission, right-click and select Delete Mission. To delete multiple missions, right-click in the Missions grid and select Delete Missions. . A dialog will appear that allows you to select missions within a specified date range. Missions that were created from the replication process display Source Mission information. Missions that were created from scratch will not show any source mission information. !!! NOTE once a mission has been committed, it cannot be deleted, only canceled. Mission Events What are Mission Events? Mission Events are action items associated to the mission. Example mission events are: Coordinate PPR, Submit ICAO Flight Plan, Mobility Processing, briefings, etc. Mission Events are a good place to track these things. How do I add a Mission Event? Place the cursor in the Mission Events grid, right-click and select Add Mission Event. A line will be generated to enter the event. How do I delete a Mission Event? Right-click on it and select Delete Mission Event. How do I add a group of Mission Events? Mission Event Sets are useful when the same mission events are used repeatedly with maybe only the dates changing. Using a Mission Event Set you don\u2019t have to build the profile from scratch each time, only the first time. Subsequently, you can simply add a Mission Event Set to a mission and identify a new base date. all the other dates wil adjust accordingly. How do I create a Mission Event Set? Enter the individual events in the Mission Events grid with dates and then right-click and select Save Mission Event Set. A dialog box will appear asking for a name and description for the set. When completed, the set will be saved and the set name will appear in the Available Mission Event Sets grid on the Mission Events Builder tab. How do I add a Mission Event Set to a mission? Highlight the desired mission and select the Mission Events Builder tab. Highlight the set in the Available Mission Event Sets grid and click the Add Set to Mission button. A dialog will appear requesting a date to offset. All the events will offset from that date. A dialog will appear asking what to do about existing Mission Events, always select Yes. How do I clear all Mission Events? Click Clear Mission Events. This deletes all mission events except Show and Post Mission End. How can I freeze a Mission Event date/time? Click Freeze/Unfreeze Date/Time. Freezing a date/time prevents cascade options from taking effect. Frozen date/times are displayed with a blue background. Sortie Events What are Sortie Events? Sortie Events are defined as a group of events that will be accomplished just before, during, and after the sortie. When you add a sortie in PEX, it comes with five standard sortie events: Show, Brief T/O, Land, and Post Sortie End. You can add others such as: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, Area Entry, and Area Exit. Sortie events can be added in the Standard view on the Mission Builder or by clicking on the Sortie Events tab. The Sortie Events grid or tab displays sortie events assigned to the highlighted sortie. Sortie events can be assigned individually or as a set to a selected sortie. How do I add individual sortie events? Right-click in the Sortie Events grid and select Add Sortie Event. A new line wil be generated to enter the event. How do I delete an individual sortie event? Right-click on it and select Delete Sortie Event. What are Sortie Event Sets? Sortie Event Sets are useful when the same sortie profile is flown repeatedly with maybe only the times/dates changing. You don\u2019t have to build the sortie profile from scratch each time, only the first time. Subsequently, you can simply add a Sortie Event set to a sortie and identify a new base time. All the other times will be adjusted accordingly. How do I build a Sortie Event Set? Enter the individual events in the Sortie Events grid or the Sortie Events Builder tab with dates and times and then right-click in the grid and select, Save Sortie Event Set. A dialog box will appear asking for a name and description for the set. When completed, the set will be saved and the set name will appear in the Available Sortie Event Sets grid on the Sortie Events Builder tab. How do I use a Sortie Event Set? To add a set to a sortie in the Sortie Events Builder tab, highlight the set and click the Add Set to Sortie button. A dialog will appear requesting a date and time to offset. All the other sortie events will offset from that date and time. Once you set the times and click \u201cOK\u201d another dialog will appear that says \u201cSome events in the set already exist in the Sortie\u201d. You have three options but we recommend that you use \u201cYes\u201d which wil replace all the sortie events. How can I use a Sortie Event Set and still retain my original ARCT data? When PEX sees an ARCT sortie event on your original sortie, the Add Set to Sortie dialog wil come up with the Sortie Event Set ARCT event pre-selected and the checkbox \"Retain Original ARCT Data\" deselected. If you want to apply your standard routing and retain the ARCT and associated (altitudes, call signs, etc.) then all you have to do is select the \u201cRetain Original ARCT Data\u201d and click OK. How do I delete a Sortie Event Set? Right-click on it and select Delete Sortie Event Set. How do I clear the sortie events off a sortie? Right-click on the sortie and select Clear Sortie Events on the Mission Builder/Standard View or the Sortie Events Builder tab. This deletes all except Show, Brief, Takeoff, Land, and Post Sortie End. How do I freeze sortie event times so they don\u2019t change? Right-click Freeze/Unfreeze Date/Time. Freezing a date/time prevents cascade options from taking effect. Frozen date/times are displayed with a blue background. Checking the CT box wil do the same. Schedule AR Tracks How do I schedule Air Refueling (AR)? Use Sortie Events to schedule the AR. In every case, enter the pertinent AR data (Cal Sign, Onload, Altitude, etc.) on the ARCP sortie event. AR Track Duration is calculated between the ARCP time and AREX time. In the case of a Reverse Track, enter the pertinent AR data on the first ARCP sortie event of the sequence and the Track Duration is calculated between the first ARCP and the final AR point in the sequence. There are four options for scheduling AR. Use the one that best suits your mission: Simple. Schedule just an ARCP sortie event. Standard. Schedule ARIP, ARCP, and AREX sortie events. Multiple ARs. Schedule the first one as a standard AR track (ARIP, ARCP, and AREX), insert some other, non-AR, sortie event(s) after the AREX, then add the next AR track (ARIP, ARCP, and AREX). Reverse AR. On the first ARCP sortie event, check the Reverse Track checkbox. Schedule the sequence as either: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP (if the time to the AREX is also scheduled/control ed) ARIP, ARCP, ARIP (if the time to the AREX is not scheduled/control ed) Scheduling Supervisors Concept. PEX allows you to schedule up to three different kinds of squadron supervisors, e.g., SOF, Top 3, and Mobile. You decide as a squadron which three types to schedule. The supervisor schedule is displayed on the Mission Board, Commitments Board, and the scheduling reports. How do I set it up? The first thing to do is to setup your squadron\u2019s Letter of X in PEX so that PEX knows who your supervisors are. Once you have created and assigned the certifications, go to the Mission Board> Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences. In the Supervisor Type area, select one Supervisor Type per line, up to three, e.g., SOF, Mobile, and TOP 3. Then click OK. Now that PEX knows your desired Supervisor Types and who meets those Certifications, you can schedule them. It\u2019s setup. How do I schedule them? To schedule supervisors, go to Mission Board> Tools> Schedule Supervisors. A dialog will appear. Right-click in the grid and select Add Supervisor Commitment. Select a Supervisor Type, then in the Short Name list select the person you want to schedule. Final y, enter the length of the commitment, any remarks, and click on another row to save (if only one row is in view, click on the header to save). Once you have entered all supervisors\u2019 commitments, click OK to close the dialog. To display or check the supervisor\u2019s schedule, click on the Faces\u201d icon on the toolbar. Troubleshooting A supervisor wil not appear in the supervisor drop down for one of three reasons: They are not assigned an \u201cis certified\u201d status in Letter of X They are expired in the respective certification in Letter of X They are \u201cdecertified\u201d with cause in the respective certification in Letter of X Lock Schedule Concept. After the flying schedule is built, you can lock key portions to prevent changes or at least require coordination between Operations and Maintenance before making the change. You can lock one sortie, a day, or a span of days. You can lock Takeoff Time, Land Time, SCL, Aircraft Configuration, MX Line Number, Tail Number, and SCL. Permissions PEXAdmin and squadron administrators. How do I lock the schedule? To lock a day or multiple days at once, display the day(s) you want to lock on the Mission Board, then click the Lock icon on the toolbar. To lock one sortie at a time, right-click on the sortie and select Lock Sortie. !!! Note If you do not have a Tail # or MDS identified in the sortie line, those fields will not lock. Once you add the Tail # or MDS you will have to re-lock the sortie. How do I unlock the schedule? Once a schedule is locked, it can be unlocked only one sortie at a time. Right-click on the sortie and select \"Unlock Sortie.\" Once unlocked, changes can be made and the sortie can be locked again. Track Changes Concept. While working in the MB, changes are not tracked until you \u201cCommit\u201d the mission (go firm). Once committed, when you make a change to a tracked item, PEX allows you to enter details about the change. To identify which items are tracked, go to Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences> Set Change Notifications. Once the tracking data is entered, you can notify the change to personnel. How do I commit missions? Normal y, they should be committed when higher authority approves the schedule. To commit a mission, right-click in the Missions grid and select Commit Mission(s). This allows you to commit all or some missions on a day or a range of days. My missions are committed. What happens now? When you make a change to a tracked field and click off the mission (not just the sortie), PEX launches a change notification dialog where you type in why the change was made. In this dialog, fill in the Authorized By, Description, Item Affected, and Remarks, Effective Date (L), and Effective Time (L) fields. This data wil be sent to recipients and entered on your PEX-generated AF 2407. If you simply want to track this change, click OK. If you want to notify the change, continue reading. How do I notify the change? In the Mission Change dialog, click the Add Mission Crew button, then click OK. This will launch your email with the crew already addressed. Use your email software to add other recipients as desired. When complete, send the email. Can I delete a committed mission? No, once a mission is committed, it cannot be deleted, only canceled. Cancellation may be recorded as a mission change. How do I cancel a mission? To cancel a mission that has been committed, highlight the mission, right-click and select Cancel Mission or check the Cnx box on the Mission line. Once a mission is canceled, all sorties, location, aircraft, and personnel commitment records attached to that mission are cancelled too. Missions that are canceled are not editable except for the Cnx and Msn Cancel Cause columns. If the mission is not canceled, the Msn Cancel Cause field is not editable. How do I un-cancel a mission? Uncheck the Cnx checkbox in the Missions grid. When a mission is uncanceled, all associated sorties will be un-canceled and commitments will be re-engaged for personnel, aircraft, and locations. How do I cancel a single sortie, not the entire mission? Only sorties of committed missions may be cancelled. The cancel sortie checkbox, Cnx, is located in the Sortie grid. Once a sortie has been canceled, all location, aircraft, and personnel commitment records attached to that sortie are cancelled. How do I un-cancel a sortie? Un-cancel a sortie by un-checking the Cnx checkbox in the Sorties grid. When a sortie is un-canceled, all commitments are re-engaged. A sortie can be un-canceled if its mission is not canceled. Tail Number Denial Concept. You can hide aircraft tail numbers from the crew until they are in a \"Go\u201d status. The purpose of this feature is to prevent crew from stepping to the aircraft before accomplishing required items. This is a completely manual process not linked to the PEX Go/No-Go page. How do I set this up? On the MB, go to View> and unselect Show Tail Numbers. On the MB, go to Tools> Options> Squadron, and enable Auto No-Go. When you add people to sorties, PEX will automatically mark their manual No-Go box. How do I use it? Add people to sorties as you normal y would. They come in with the manual No-Go box checked. The sortie tail number is hidden if anyone on the crew is marked No-Go. Verify a person has completed all required actions for proceeding to the aircraft and uncheck their box. For one or two person crews, the box can be unchecked from the MB Sorties grid. For crews of three or more, the box must be unchecked in the Flying Schedule> Crew tab> Crew Details dialog. Only the following permission roles can uncheck the box: Ops Desk, Training Auditor/Arms, Administrator, and Flight Schedulers. When all crew on a sortie have unchecked No-Go boxes, the tail number will display. How does this affect Maintenance? The MX Scheduling permission role has permission to see tail numbers at all times. Export to TAP Concept. This function allows you to export PEX mission data to a file that can be imported by the TBMCS (Theater Battle Management Core Systems) Force Level TAP (Theater Air Planner). Use this function to add missions developed in PEX to the Air Tasking Order (ATO). This function is mostly used by Special Forces. How do I use it? Build your missions/sorties normally in PEX. Enter as much TAP data as you have for the sortie on each of the sortie events you want to export to TAP. Check the Sortie Event \"CT\" block for sortie events with control times.

Note PEX automatically removes dashes from MDSs. E.g., \"MC-130\" will export as \"MC130\". When ready to create the TAP export file, in the PEX MB, select \"Tools, Export to TAP\u2026\" The \"Export to TAP\" dialog will appear. The dialog will display all the same missions/sorties displayed on the Mission Board. Using the \"Export TAP File Location/Name\" browse button, select the location and name to save the file about to be created. (If known) Type in the ATO ID, ACO, and Revision #. Enter your ATO Unit ID and Service. Click \"Save Settings\" to enter this Unit ID and Service for all your missions. Select the missions you want exported to the file. Each PEX mission selected wil generate an \"AIRMSN\" record on the export file. From among the missions you select for export, select the events you want to export. Clicking the \"Show only CT Events\" box wil filter your list down to just events that have control times. Each PEX sortie event selected wil generate a \"TASK\" record on the export file. When you have all the missions and events selected, click \"Export.\" The generated file can be imported by TAP. Distance, Time, and Fuel Concept. The Mission Board, Sortie Events grid displays the exact distance, approximate time, and approximate fuel between event points. It also provides totals of all the above in the Post Sortie End line. These figures provide the scheduler an estimate of fuel required for the sortie. It does not, obviously, replace detailed crew mission planning. How do I set this up? Aircraft Module. In the Aircraft MDS grid, enter the average speed (KTAS) and average fuel flow for the MDS. Fuel flow can be entered as any amount per hour, e.g., pounds per hour or gal ons per hour. Locations Module. Enter latitudes and longitudes for all your flying locations or at least the ones you use frequently. OK, how do I use it? Schedule sortie events the way you normally do, making sure a location is specified. Distance. PEX calculates the great circle distance (NM) between your sortie event points. If an event has no location specified or the location has all zeroes for the lat/long, PEX wil skip over that event and calculate the distance to the next event. Time. PEX divides the distance by the average speed to derive a calculated (approximate) time, then PEX uses the greater of Calculated Time or Scheduled Time. If the Calculated Time between two Sortie Events is less than the Scheduled Time, PEX wil use the Scheduled Time. For example, if PEX calculates it wil take 15 minutes to get somewhere but you schedule 30 minutes, PEX wil use 30 minutes as the time. If the Calculated Time between two Sortie Events is more than the Scheduled Time, PEX uses the Calculated Time. For example, if PEX calculates it will take 15 minutes to get somewhere but you schedule only 10 minutes, PEX wil 15 minutes as the time. Fuel. PEX multiplies the time by the average fuel flow to calculate the approximate fuel (pounds or gal ons depending on how the fuel flow was entered). Use the bottom-line (Post Sortie End) sortie event to get an idea of how much fuel is needed for the sortie. Miscellaneous Deconfliction. As you add people and aircraft to the schedule, PEX compares the mission start date/time and the mission end date/time to other commitments. If there are conflicts, a message box will appear that asks, \"Possible conflicts. Do you still want to add item?\u201d If you select \u201cYes\u201d, the person or aircraft will be added to the schedule. Can I use the MB for display? The Squadron Daily Schedule module was designed as a replacement for using the MB as a flight schedule display. However, if you prefer to use the MB in a Full Screen, Auto-Refresh mode, select File> Ful Screen. While in Ful Screen mode, the record of interest is not indicated by a dark blue line like it normally is, but all MB functionality is available. To exit Ful Screen, hold down the Alt key and hit F twice. Can I use the MB for JTAC Scheduling? Yes, you should. Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) missions could be scheduled using the Commitments Board (CB); however, better functionality is obtained by using the MB. Using the MB, you can copy and paste large Remarks into the Mission Remarks field. With the CB, the Remarks have to be copied one line at a time. Using the MB, you generate a Sortie Details Report on My Page, where your JTAC personnel can see what they are scheduled for and the other personnel on the mission (neither of which is obtained by using the CB). What do the colored names mean? Red indicates overdue a Priority 1 training task (supervision required) Orange indicates manual No-Go Blue indicates both of the above How do I enter actual takeoff and land times? Click on the \u201cclock with an A\u201d icon and the actual time fields wil display in the Sortie grid. If you want to enter the current time, just click in the time field. If you want to change it from current time, click in the field and edit. If the time has already been saved, you will need to right-click on the time field and select \u201cAdjust Actual\u201d then you can change the times. This is to prevent accidental changes. If you click on the field for sorties at least one day in the past it will put scheduled time in the field. Can I filter the list of sorties? Yes, click on the Filter icon. You can filter by MDS, Sortie Type, or both. This is useful if you want to filter out simulators and/or alert sorties. What do the other icons do? M Icon with a slash through it - will hide the Mission grid if you have the Fighter view Selected The M icon with a line up and down - expands the Mission grid in the Standard view The S icon with a line up and down - expands the Sorties grid in the Standard view The S# icon - will re-number your sorties The L# icon - will re-number your line numbers The icon with two heads - displays the Supervisor schedule Custom Flight Schedule This function is no longer available; it has been made obsolete by the Scheduling Reports, especially the Custom Schedule. Personnel Availability \u00b6 Displaying Personnel Availability Data Select a squadron in the Squadron drop-down list that has scheduled availability periods. Select a person from the Personnel drop-down list. When a person is selected, the Availability grid will display the selected person\u2019s availability data from the database and the date it was last updated. In the Availability grid, ToolTip notations on the Date field will list the day of the week/Julian Scheduling date and ToolTips on the Availability Type code field will list the Availability Type Description. Updating Personnel Availability Electronically This is a three-step process. First, create a Personnel Availability Import File and send it to your personnel. Second, as the files are returned completed, you store them in a folder. Third, when you are ready, import the data. Creating the Personnel Availability Import File. This is a single file that you will send out to your squadron personnel where they can fill in, by month, when and how they are available. The file will automatically include your squadron's Availability Periods and Availability Types. Select \"Tools, Create Import File. .\" to launch the dialog. Then, select the Month/Year for which you want availability entered and click \"Create File.\" The file will automatically be saved to Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Outgoing folder unless you specify otherwise. Now that the file is created, use your Email software to send it to your personnel. The file includes instructions on how to fill it out. Storing Filled-In Import Files. As your personnel return the files filled in with their availability, save them to Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming folder or as desired. Importing Personnel Availability Files. Select the squadron for which you want to import personnel availability data. Then, select \"Tools, Import Availability. .\" to launch the dialog. Click \"Select Files\" to see a list of all the files available for import, these files will normally be located at Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming folder unless you have specified otherwise. Once you have selected your desired files, normally select all of them, click OK. The selected files will be listed and you can then click \"Import.\" Once a file has been successfully read and entered into the PEX database, the file will be automatically renamed \"Imported\" + the original file name. Changes. Personnel can use the same import file to update availability data they previously sent you. They simply re-do their availability for the month and send it to you. You will know they are changing their availability by receipt of a another file for the same month. When you import the updated file, it will delete their previous inputs for the month and replace it with the new. Errors. A log file is created each time files are imported. If personnel make errors filling out the import file, the specific error is listed so you can go into the file and fix it. Any file with errors will remain in the Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming directory until successfully imported. Adding Personnel Availability Data Manually For one or few days: Select the days on the calendar in the Select By Day section and click Add. This wil move the selected day to the Selected Days list box. Or, For many days, use the Select by Days of Week grouping: Set the Date Span inside of which the available days will fall. Select the All Days radio button to set all of the days in the Date Span inside the Selected Days window or select the By Day radio button to set multiple instances of a certain day, and select the check boxes of the days to place in the Selected Days list. Once the days are selected, set period availability by highlighting the days in the Selected Days list. The highlighting may be done individually or all days may be highlighted using the Select all button. The Unselect All button will remove the highlighting from all highlighted days in the list box. Use the Set Availability group to assign availability either All Day or By Period, the periods as Hard or Soft, and the Availability Types. Click Add to send the date(s) and availability to the Availability grid. Select Apply to save the data to the database. !!! Note The meaning of Hard and Soft is unit-defined. E.g., Hard could mean the crewmember will show up for whatever is scheduled without the scheduler double-checking. Soft could mean that the crewmember is probably available but the scheduler should check before relying on the crewmember to actual y show up. !!! Note Availability Types are unit-defined in Setup, Validation. Removing Personnel Availability Data Manually Remove days from the Availability grid by selecting one or more days and pressing the Remove button. The dates will be moved from the Availability grid to the Selected Days list. To remove a day completely, highlight it and click Remove in the Selected Days group. To change the availability, see next paragraph. Editing Personnel Availability Data Manually Select the date in the Availability grid, and click the Remove button. The date will be removed from the Availability grid and added to the Selected Days list. Select the day in the list and set the Period Availability, then select Hard or Soft and Availability Type for the period(s). Click the Add button to add the date to the Availability grid.

Select the Supervisor types from the selected squadrons. Select the Commitment types you want to appear from the selected squadrons. Select \"PDF\" to get a read-only type file or \"Excel\" to get an editable file. Your selections for each schedule (e.g., Fighter or Bomber) are saved as user preferences. Times. \"(L)\" times on the schedule are local times at the location specified, e.g., landing at KHIF at 09:00 (L) is Hill AFB local time. Ground events and the supervisor schedule display the local time of the user logged in based on their location. The celestial data (L) time is also the local time of the PEX user logged in. User locations are set in the Users and Permissions module. Changes in Red. The schedule can show in red, data that has changed since the schedule was committed. To setup this feature, go to the Mission Board, Tools, Options, Squadron Preferences tab, and select the items to track (show in red) if changed. Later, commit the schedule as normal. If any tracked item changes after the commit, it will show in red on the schedule. Certain calculated values (i.e., Pattern Time and AR Track Duration) will never show red, even if they changed. Neither wil the following values show in red: Actual Takeoff Time, Actual Land Time, and a person's Weather Category (\"WX\"). Air Refueling (AR) Data. PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events: ARIP, ARET, ARCP, ARCT, AREX, AREXIT, and ARINFO. If it finds any of them, they wil appear on the schedule. AREX or AREXIT defines the end of a sequence of AR events, e.g., ARIP, ARCP, and AREX would define a single AR sequence. Within an AR sequence, the first supporting data entered against any of the AR events wil show up on the schedule. For example, if you load some of the AR data (Seq #, Alt, Rz Type, for example) on the ARIP line and the rest (Onload, Priority, for example) on the ARCP line, that will work fine. If you load the same type of data, e.g., Seq #, on two different lines within the same sequence, the schedule wil print only the first one. For example, if you enter Sequence Number \"1201\" on the ARIP line and \"1502\" on the ARCP line; it's the \"1201\" that wil show up. Bottom-line, enter the supporting data on any line of the AR sequence but only once. AR track duration is calculated as the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the AREX sortie events. Reverse Track. Define a Reverse AR track in PEX by checking the \u201dReverse Track\u201d box on the first \u201dAREX\u201d sortie event. PEX wil then disregard the second AREX and ARCP times and use the final ARIP time as real AREX time. PEX assumes a reverse AR track has the following sortie events sequence: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP. AR Track duration is the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the final AREX (which is really the geographic ARIP). Airspace and Range Data. The flying schedules (except Custom Schedule) provide options to show airspace/range Name, Entry Time, IP (Initial Point) Time, and/or Exit Time. If you use the Sortie Events Builder tab to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events to populate the following airspace/range data: Entry time: \"LL EP\", \"Area Entry\", and \"ALTN EP\" IP time: \"IP\" (but will display only if followed by LL EX, Area Exit, or ALTN EX) 3) Exit time: \"LL EX\", \"Area Exit\", and \"ALTN EX\" !!! Note If the Entry, IP, and Exit locations are the same (e.g., IR 275), PEX will list the times on one line. If the locations are different (e.g., IR 175 PtA, IR 175 IP, and IR 175 PtZ), PEX will list the times on separate lines. If you use the Mission Builder tab, Sorties grid, Airspace columns to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX include whatever you schedule for airspace/range Start Time and End Time. If you use the Custom Schedule report, the airspace process is simpler and more generic. Any PEX Sortie Event or Airspace that you schedule between the Takeoff and Land times, that has a Location Name specified, wil show up on the report when you select Location, Airspace Entry, or Airspace Exit. Exit/End Time is based on Sortie Event Duration or Airspace End Time. Miscellaneous. If \"IAF\" is entered as a sortie event on the Bomber Schedule, the IAF time wil display on the schedule and \"Pattern Time\" wil calculate as the time between the IAF time and Land time. If \u201dBus\u201d is entered as a sortie event, the \u201dBus\u201d local time will show. Crew will show up in the same order as on the Flying Schedule/Crew module. If the order is not as desired on this report, make the change on the Flying Schedule> Crew tab. If a person is assigned a WX Cat (Personnel> Quals & Certs), the fighter schedule will display the category in parentheses to the right of the crew position. This applies when the person has a MDS qualification matching that scheduled on the sortie. If the MDS is different, the parentheses are empty. MADO (Missile Alert Duty Order) The MADO authorizes missile crews to perform alert duty. The form auto-populates with PEX data from the Scheduler and you can create templates. Generate the MADO Navigate to Scheduling > Reports > MADO tab. Select the date for which you want to create a MADO. Select a squadron(s). Select a template, if desired. Click View. MADO data sources Block item fields listed below as \"Template\" means it is a template item or can be manually added when the form opens in PDF. Block 1, NUMBER: Year followed by Julian Date (e.g. 2015-339). Block 2, THE FOLLOWING MISSILE COMBAT CREWS ARE ASSIGNED MISSILE ALERT DUTY DURING THE PERIOD: From the Scheduler using ICBM (e.g. 05 Dec 15-06 Dec 15). Block 3, LOC/TRIP#: Trip # populates with the first two numbers as the date using a leading zero if necessary. The first two numbers are followed by a hyphen. The next character will be the first character of the location (LCC). The last digit is the sequential numbering within the crew (1 or 2). Example: B01/06-B1 (MCCC) and B01/06-B2 (DMCCC). A1/A2 crew example: addition of \u201cB01/06-B3\u201d and \u201cB01/06-B4\u201d. If only 2 crew members for the LCC location/Mission then the sequential numbers will be 1 for the MCCC line and 2 for the DMCCC. If it is a 4 person crew for the LCC location/Mission then it will be 1 for the MCCC line, 2 for the DMCCC, 3 for the MCCC, and 4 for the DMCCC. Each MADO line Duty Position field is hard coded to MCCC then the next line is DMCC and so on. Block 4, CREW #: From the Personnel module field \u201cCrew #\u201d for the scheduled person.

Go to Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Mission Board > Sortie Event, and add \u201cMSN LOAD\u201d (it must be spelled this way). At the Mission Board > Sortie Events Builder > Available Sortie events, you should now see MSN LOAD. Add this sortie event to your sortie and give it a time. It\u2019ll now show up on the AFSOC Form 40. !!! Note To get mission loads they must first be added in the Weapons module, then scheduled on the Flying Schedule > Loads tab. They\u2019ll now show up on the AFSOC Form 40. Flying Schedules How to Use. These are the new schedules, found under \"Scheduling, Reports\" in both ePEX and WinPEX (the screen with the DoD logo): !!! Note When launching the reports in Excel, on the Windows Vista operating system, on the Windows File Download dialog, \"Save\" the report first, do not \"Open\" it directly. Select the format of the schedule you want: Fighter Schedule or Bomber Schedule. Start on the \"Sorties\" tab and select which sorties you want to appear on the schedule: Select the date range and whether you want times displayed in Local or Zulu. Locations with no Zulu Rule or DST Offset entered in the PEX Locations module will also display in Zulu only. Select the squadron(s) from which you want sorties. Select the MDS(s) you want to appear. Pick whether you want Alert, TDY, Cancelled, and/or Spare sorties to appear. (Alert, TDY, and Cancelled are set in the Mission Board in the Missions grid. Spare sorties are created by including \"sp\" anywhere in the Mission Board Line Number field, e.g., \"601sp\".) Select \"Show Only Actual Sorties\" to get an after-action report of what actually flew (sorties with Actual Takeoff and Land times entered on the Mission Board) in actual takeoff order. Select \"BASH Window\" to display the Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazard window of time. This window is setup in the Squadrons module. Finally, in the \"Display\" area, pick the columns you want to appear on the schedule. Move on to the \"Ground\" tab and select what ground scheduling data (Personnel Commitments) you want to appear. In the \"Show\" area, select whether to even display the \"Ground\" data at all and whether to label the entire schedule as \"SECRET.\" Select the squadron(s) from which you want personnel commitments to appear. Final y, select the supervisor types and commitment types you want to appear. Select \"PDF\" to get an Adobe Acrobat read-only type file or \"Excel\" to get Microsoft editable file. Your selections for each schedule (e.g., Fighter or Bomber) are saved as user preferences. Times. \"(L)\" times on the schedule are local times at the location specified, e.g., landing at KHIF at 09:00 ( L) is Hill AFB local time. Ground events and the supervisor schedule display the local time of the user logged in based on their location. The celestial data ( L) time is also the local time of the PEX user logged in. User locations are set in the Users and Permissions module. Changes in Red. The schedule can show in red, data that has changed since the schedule was committed. To setup this feature, go to the Mission Board, Tools, Options, Squadron Preferences tab, and select the items to track (show in red) if changed. Later, commit the schedule as normal. If any tracked item changes after the commit, it will show in red on the schedule. Certain calculated values (i.e., Pattern Time and AR Track Duration) will never show red, even if they changed. Neither will the following values show in red: Actual Takeoff Time, Actual Land Time, and a person's Weather Category (\"WX\"). Air Refueling (AR) Data. PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events: ARIP, ARET, ARCP, ARCT, AREX, AREXIT, and ARINFO. If it finds any of them, they wil appear on the schedule. AREX or AREXIT defines the end of a sequence of AR events, e.g., ARIP, ARCP, and AREX would define a single AR sequence. Within an AR sequence, the first supporting data entered against any of the AR events wil show up on the schedule. For example, if you load some of the AR data (Seq #, Alt, Rz Type, for example) on the ARIP line and the rest (Onload, Priority, for example) on the ARCP line, that will work fine. If you load the same type of data, e.g., Seq #, on two different lines within the same sequence, the schedule will print only the first one. For example, if you enter Sequence Number \"1201\" on the ARIP line and \"1502\" on the ARCP line; it's the \"1201\" that wil show up. Bottom-line, enter the supporting data on any line of the AR sequence but only once. AR track duration is calculated as the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the AREX sortie events. Reverse Track. Define a Reverse AR track in PEX by checking the \u201dReverse Track\u201d box on the first \u201dAREX\u201d sortie event. PEX will then disregard the second AREX and ARCP times and use the final ARIP time as real AREX time. PEX assumes a reverse AR track has the following sortie events sequence: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP. AR Track duration is the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the final AREX (which is really the geographic ARIP). Airspace and Range Data. The flying schedules (except Custom Schedule) provide options to show airspace/range Name, Entry Time, IP (Initial Point) Time, and/or Exit Time. If you use the Sortie Events Builder tab to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events to populate the following airspace/range data: Entry time: \"LL EP\", \"Area Entry\", and \"ALTN EP\" IP time: \"IP\" (but will display only if followed by LL EX, Area Exit, or ALTN EX) 3) Exit time: \"LL EX\", \"Area Exit\", and \"ALTN EX\" !!! Note If the Entry, IP, and Exit locations are the same (e.g., IR 275), PEX wil list the times on one line. If the locations are different (e.g., IR 175 PtA, IR 175 IP, and IR 175 PtZ), PEX will list the times on separate lines. If you use the Mission Builder tab, Sorties grid, Airspace columns to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX include whatever you schedule for airspace/range Start Time and End Time. If you use the Custom Schedule report, the airspace process is simpler and more generic. Any PEX Sortie Event or Airspace that you schedule between the Takeoff and Land times, that has a Location Name specified, wil show up on the report when you select Location, Airspace Entry, or Airspace Exit. Exit/End Time is based on Sortie Event Duration or Airspace End Time. Miscellaneous. If \"IAF\" is entered as a sortie event, the IAF time wil display on the schedule and \"Pattern Time\" will calculate as the time between the IAF time and Land time. If \u201dBus\u201d is entered as a sortie event, the \u201dBus\u201d local time will show up in Remarks. A cancelled sortie will show up with a gray background and \u201dCANX\u201d in the Mission Number field. Crew will show up in the same order as on the Mission Board/Flying Schedule module. If the order is not as desired on this report, make the change on the Mission Board/Flying Schedule module. If a person is assigned a WX Cat (Personnel> Quals & Certs), the fighter schedule will display the category in parentheses to the right of the crew position. This applies when the person has a MDS qualification matching that scheduled on the sortie. If the MDS is different, the parentheses are empty. Bomber Schedule New Prototype. PEX 5.12 includes a prototype for an improved flying schedule report. Please send the Help Desk any feedback you have on this prototype. To make maximum use of this report: In the WinPEX Labels module, at Scheduling \u2013 Mission Board \u2013 Mission Builder, re-label IFF to IFC, OFP, or Block as desired. Use that field on the Mission Board and it will show up on the schedule. Enter all your AR data on the ARCP sortie event line. Personnel Fly Hours Concept. This report is used to provide the total flying hours flown within a 7, 30, 60, and 90 day period, as derived from the Aviation Resources Management System (ARMS), to help ensure personnel do not exceed mandated limits. How do I generate the report? Open the report interface by navigating to Scheduling > Reports > 7/30/60/90 Hours tab. Personnel Tab. Select criteria by starting in the left column, which will narrow down the search as you go left to right. Select the Squadron(s) of the people you want to list Select the desired flight(s) Select whether you want to list aircrew (by MDS) or non-aircrew (by DAFSC). Subsequently, select the desired MDS(s) or DAFSC(s). Select the desired Certification Code, Crew Position, and MAJCOM Quals 3, 4, and 5 Select the desired Certifications. !!! Note This list uses an \"AND\" filter; the person must possess all of the selected certifications. Select whether to sort the list by Name, Flight, or Hours Flag Parameters Tab. Select the Columns that you desire on the report Then, for each of the 7, 30, 60, and 90 day periods, select minimum and maximum values to highlight. If the person is below the minimum value, the report will highlight the value yellow. If the person is above the maximum value, the report will highlight the value red. View the report by selecting PDF or Excel. You can then print from PDF by selecting the print icon, or from Excel by selecting Ctrl + P. Personnel Schedule This report is used to provide a weekly (7-day) schedule, combining flying and ground activities.

Enter optional data in the six \"Report Footer Fields\" to customize the report 7. In the \"Show These Report Sections\" area, user must select at least one of the sections in order to return scheduling data. Scheduler \u00b6 Scheduler Basics Overview The Scheduler module is in development to replace many of the existing scheduling modules, in order to achieve a single workspace to build schedules. Schedules can be generated for Missions, Production Request or Events. Currently, data you input into the Scheduler module does not feed into any other part of PEX (e.g., the My Page, Long Range Scheduler module, Shift Schedule or Commitments Board), it does however communicate with the Go/NoGo module. Permissions PEX Administrator and Scheduling Administrator: can build/edit/delete Missions, Events, Production Requests, and can work with ful access within the module. Scheduler Read Only: allows users to view the schedule only. Module Notes The Scheduler module is only accessible in ePEX. To add a location in Scheduler, the location must be established within PEX via the Locations module. Controls The Scheduler is accessed from the PEX navigation panel > Scheduling > Scheduler. Workspace Calendar and Timeline: View schedules in calendar (shown) or timeline display. Date span. Time Zone selection. View the selected span and by zone by month, week, three-day or 1-day. Squadron and Event Type filter selector. Select Publish or Unpublish mode (when enabled.) Add Events and Event Templates; Common Event Templates are Event, Mission and Production Request. Screen refresh. Setup Functions: Create Event Templates Create Resource Role Templates Add and edit Lookup Lists. Establish settings Enable Publish mode: On/Off Enable Mission Planning Sheet: On/Off Group Events: On/Off Select display Time Zone Events on selected date. Time Zone Selection The displayed time zone can be changed several ways. all take you to the Select Time Zone dialog. Time Zone is in Calendar, Timeline, and Settings. Within the dialog you can page to the desired zone or use the type-ahead field to look for text. Click the time zone (in blue) on the date display to change on the fly. Click the Event > Event Details > time zone (in blue). More Options (...) button > Settings > Time Zone. Filters With filters Off, you will see all squadrons and all events. Access Squadron and Event Type filters with the funnel icon. Use the switches to select Squadron or Event Type, and click on Squadron or Event Type. When the filter list opens, check Select All or the applicable filter item. Use the back arrows to return to the main display with filters applied. Terms These apply to terms found in the Scheduler module. Draft. Draft entries are only visible for users with Scheduling Admin rights to the entry\u2019s owning squadron. Users with Scheduling Admin rights can set scheduling entries to Publish for the squadrons to which they have Scheduling Admin rights. Scheduling Admins can Publish the events or the events and their resources. Published entries are then also viewable by Users with Scheduling Read Only rights the entry\u2019s owning squadron. Event. A block of time defined by a start date/time and an end date/time, or all -day. Delivered events can be categorized as Events, Missions, or Production Requests, or they can be user-defined. Event Group. A collection of events. You can apply changes to all member events of the group by changing them in one central place. Changes to individual member events are still possible. Group Events. When enabled, scheduling entries are grouped by Production Requests, Missions, and Events on the Calendar View and ordered by start time within in each grouping. All-day events are grouped at the top of the display and ordered by start time. Issue. A condition that may impede an event. Issues include NoGo items (e.g., DNIF or overdue training), overlapping events (conflicts), and mismatched roles and resources. Mission Planning Sheet. Used primarily by the DCGS community, a Mission Planning Sheet can be generated for any Production Request, Mission, or Event. The Mission Planning Sheet menu item is then visible in the menu for any selected scheduled Production Request, Mission, or Event. Production Request. Publish Mode. When enabled, sets new entries to Draft. Resource. An item, person, place or thing, that can be added to a scheduled event, individual y or in groups.

Best Practice Existing PEX sorties cannot be linked to imported ATO sorties. If you build a flying schedule in PEX, in anticipation of an ATO, when you subsequently import the ATO into PEX, you wil end up with two sets of sorties: your anticipated sorties and your imported ATO sorties. You do not want this. What you want is a single set of sorties with your ATO data. To do that: Build your anticipated ATO flying schedule outside of PEX, in Excel for example. This anticipated schedule would include: # of Lines and Formations, MDS, Tail Number, SCLs, Crew, Show, and Brief Times. Import the ATO into PEX. Let PEX build the draft flying schedule based on the ATO. Transfer the data from your anticipated schedule (Tail #, SCLs, Crew, Show, and Brief Times) into the ATO-imported sorties in PEX. Import an ATO into PEX In the ATO module, browse to the location of the ATO file. PEX reads the ATO and displays aircraft missions in the Mission Summary grid. Non-aircraft missions are not displayed, e.g., naval missile taskings (a MTGTLOC data set with no accompanying MSNACFT data set). The grid displays either all ATO missions or just the missions for the ATO units you have mapped to a PEX squadron, depending on your selection. By default, the ATO mission goes to the mapped squadron and is assigned to the default aircraft type (MDS) for that squadron, but these can be changed before importing. Select the missions you want to add to the PEX database. If required, update the squadrons and MDSs to which the missions wil be assigned in PEX and click Import/Update. After you import, PEX saves general ATO data and all the data tied to the missions you selected. Some of the imported mission data is not viewable in the PEX Mission Board but all data for a selected mission is available in the PEX database via web services. Data for missions not selected in the Mission Summary grid is not saved to the PEX database. !!! Note A mission is identified as having a target (TGT) if it includes any of the following ATO data sets: GTGTLOC, MTGTLOC, or SHIPTGT. A mission is identified as having air refueling (AR) if it includes any of the following ATO data sets: ARINFO, 5REFUEL, or REFTSK. Associate your PEX Squadron to an ATO Unit As a time-saver, once you know how your PEX squadron is identified in the ATO, link it so you don\u2019t have to select it in the Mission Summary grid for every mission you want imported. To do this, click the Display Only Mapped Squadrons hyperlink and a grid will appear listing all the PEX squadrons and a place to type in the ATO designation for each. PEX Missions ATO missions do not match one-for-one to PEX missions but they wil have the same mission number. An ATO mission may contain multiple MDSs. A PEX mission is created for each ATO mission MSNACFT data set. In other words, if the ATO mission contains a MSNACFT data set for F15E and another for B52H; PEX will create two missions, one for the F15E and another for the B52H. PEX Sorties PEX will create sorties based on the number of aircraft in the MSNACFT data set and/or the number of legs in AIRMOVE taskings. PEX will apply its formation logic to multi-aircraft (MSNACFT) missions. Takeoff and Land Locations PEX establishes these locations from the ATO AMSNDAT set DEPLOC and ARRLOC fields. If there are no values in those fields, then PEX uses the Mission Board user-defined default takeoff location. !!! caution Your Database could have three instances of the same location, for example: PEX KDMA, ATO KDMA, and ACO KDMA. If you imported an ACO, then the locations have relatively complete definitions including Lat/Long coordinates. When the ATO import occurs, PEX will look to see if you have an ACO location that matches (e.g., ACO KDMA). If it finds it, then it uses that one on for the sortie. If it does not find it, it searches for an ATO location (e.g., ATO KDMA) and uses it. If it finds neither, it creates a new location of Source = ATO and uses that one. The issue for you is that PEX creates the ATO location KDMA, but it does not know its Lat/Long. Go to Setup > Locations and enter Lat/Longs for frequently used ATO locations. Takeoff and Land Times ATOs do not normally specify takeoff or land times. PEX calculates an estimated takeoff and land time for each ATO sortie. For speed, PEX uses the Speed entered in the Aircraft Module for the sortie MDS. If no speed is entered, PEX uses 350 knots ground speed. To determine takeoff time, PEX uses the first controlled (frozen) sortie event time, for example, a 5REFUEL with an ARCT of 10:40 at location EXXON BLUE. If PEX finds the Lat/Long of EXXON BLUE (from the ACO import) and if PEX finds the Lat/Long of the takeoff location, then PEX calculates a reasonable time enroute. If that turns out to be 35 minutes, then PEX calculates an estimated takeoff time of 10:05. If any of the required Lat/Long information is missing, PEX defaults to one hour prior, or 09:40 in our example. To calculate an estimated land time, PEX uses the last control ed (frozen) sortie event time. Controlled (Frozen) Times PEX creates Sortie Events with frozen times for the following ATO data sets: AIRDROP (airdrop mission data) AMSNLOC (location data for missions with no target) ARINFO (refueling data for the receiver) ASACSDAT (air control data) (no time) ASUPTFOR (data on missions being supported) (no time) CONTROLA (control data) (no time) GTGTLOC (target location and description) MTGTLOC (missile target data) PTRCPLOT (reconnaissance mission location data) (no time) RECCEDAT (reconnaissance data) REFTSK (refueling data for the tanker) SHIPTGT (naval target data) 1MSNRTE (data on an established flight route) 5REFUEL (receiver refueling data for the tanker) 7CONTROL (data on controlled assets) ATO Changes Handle an ATO update just like an original ATO: browse to the change ATO file, select your missions, and click Import/Update. Missions with a gray background in the Squadron and Aircraft fields are already in PEX and wil be updated when you select Import/Update. Missions with a white background in the Squadron and Aircraft fields are new missions and will be added to PEX when you select Import/Update. The log file will provide a list of cancelled, added, and updated missions. !!! danger Before importing an ATO change, ensure the original ATO has been imported. Check the Log Files to verify which ATOs and updates have been imported. If you inadvertently import an older version of the ATO than the one already in PEX, all subsequent ATO changes must be re-imported to ensure you have the latest data. !!! caution PEX pre-selects all the missions in the Mission Summary grid for updating and adding. Unless you have a good reason for not updating or adding a mission, do not un-check the box next to the mission before clicking Import/Update. Missions. If an ATO mission is cancelled, it will be cancelled in PEX. If the ATO update adds a mission, it will display in the Mission Summary grid so that it can be selected and added to the PEX database. Sorties. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination matches one already in PEX, PEX updates the ATO data for the original mission. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination has more aircraft than the original, an additional sortie(s) is added to PEX. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination has fewer aircraft than the original, PEX cancels the extra sortie(s). AIRMOVE. If the number of AIRMOVE taskings differs in the update from the current number of AIRMOVE taskings, PEX cancels all of that mission's sorties and adds new sorties in their place. If the number of AIRMOVE taskings is the same, PEX updates the data for the sorties. Sortie Events. The data from the first updated ATO data set that matches an ATO data set in the original ATO is used to update only the ATO fields for that data set. For example, if the original ATO mission included a GTGTLOC, then the first GTGTLOC data set in the change ATO for that mission is used to update the original. Data entered manually through PEX for that GTGTLOC sortie event remains unaffected. If an additional ATO data set is in the change ATO, it is added to the mission. Using the previous example, if the original ATO had only one GTGTLOC and the change ATO includes two for the same mission, the additional GTGTLOC is added as another sortie event in PEX. If the change ATO does not contain a data set that was included in the original ATO, the sortie event is deleted from PEX for that mission. Troubleshooting \u2013 Not All ATO Missions Show Up When you browse to an ATO file, PEX parses out the units so you can pick which ones to import. If you know PEX did not list all the ATO units, there is a parsing problem, most likely caused by an ATO format error. When PEX encounters an ATO format error, subsequent units do not show up in the PEX list. To troubleshoot a problematic ATO: Save the original ATO and make five copies. In the first ATO copy, delete an entire TASKCNTRY section (including all its TASKUNITs). Save the modified ATO and use the PEX ATO module to browse to it again. PEX will parse out the units. If all the correct units show up, the ATO format problem is somewhere in the TASKCNTRY section you deleted. If all the correct units still do not show up, the problem is in another TASKCNTRY section. Keep removing TASKCNTRY sections until the ATO parses ok and you wil have identified the problematic TASKCNTRY section. In the second ATO copy, now that you\u2019ve identified the problematic TASKCNTRY section, repeat the above removal procedures for TASKUNIT sections (within the problematic TASKNTRY) until you identify the problematic TASKUNIT. In the third ATO copy, now that you've identified the problematic TASKUNIT, repeat the above removal procedures for each AMSNDAT group (including all sub-sets, such as MSNACFT, ARINFO, AMPN, GTGTLOC, etc.) until you identify the problematic mission (AMSNDAT group). In the fourth ATO copy, now that you've identified the problematic mission group, remove its subsets, one-by-one, until the ATO parses ok. Once you've identified the problematic sub-set (AMPN for example), compare its format to the USMTF approved format and you should find the problem, for example, one too many slashes. In the fifth ATO copy, fix the error manually and use the PEX ATO module to browse to it. It should parse correctly and list all units.","title":"ATO - Import an Air Tasking Order"},{"location":"PEX/Scheduling.html#bids-and-availability","text":"Bids and Availability- Basics Introduction Bids and Availability is a tool used to analyze personnel \u201cwants\u201d with scheduling \u201cneeds\u201d.

It wil also instruct you on how to open and close bids for your unit. A squadron scheduler wil open a bid for a commitment, to give personnel the opportunity to apply/be selected for a particular event (e.g., NCO leadership school or ADLS Training) !!! Note In order for B&A to work correctly there must be other scheduling modules in use. For example, there must be a Commitment created in Commitments Board in order for a Scheduler to open up a bid on a group commitment (i.e. a training group commitment for ALS training, or TDY to Hawaii). Crew Panel. The scheduler uses the Crew Panel to display personnel and when an individual is selected, to activate data within the other grids (calendar, details for people and Bids for commitments). Select a filter (either use the funnel or use the drop down next to the funnel to select a filter). Names will populate in crew panel. Select a name, some or all. Use shift/control keys to select multiple names. Once a name(s) is/are selected, their \u201cdetails for People\u201d information will appear to see their availability, commitments, or currency (number 3 in the above graphic).

Delete an Event Click on the event you want to delete to select it. Click on the Delete Event button it. !!! warning There is no undo function if you delete it by mistake. !!! Note Deleting an Event does not delete any commitments that were assigned to it, nor does it remove any people, equipment, or crew templates that were assigned to those commitments. It simply deletes the overall Event information. Mission Planning Sheet The Mission Planning Sheet (MPS) is designed for the Distributed Ground Control Station (DCGS) community. It resides in the Commitments Board and is designed to assist scheduling coordination. Commitment and personnel data automatically populate and additional remarks can be added. The MPS editor includes date/time stamped approval options. The MPS editor includes Letter of X warning flags when scheduled individuals are overdue, decertified, and/or expired for certifications. Setup the Mission Planning Sheet (MPS) Go to Setup> Personnel> Setup> Office Symbol Right-click Add. Right-click Add again (enter directly in the master list, not the unit\u2019s list). Enter \u201c[Unit]/CC\u201d for the office symbol, with [unit] being the name of the unit in the PEX database. For example, if the name of the unit in the PEX database is 80 FS, then the office symbol needs to be entered as \u201c80 FS/CC\u201d. In the Personnel Tab, assign that office symbol to the unit commander. Only one person in the unit should have this office symbol, otherwise, it may not return the correct person. Regardless, this field in the MPS can be overwritten and/or manually entered. How to Use the Mission Planning Sheet In the Commitments Board, build a commitment using a Crew Template. Add personnel to fill the template positions. !!! Note When building a crew template, a role can be required or optional. These people are listed in the MPS Editor as \u201cPersonnel with Roles\u201d. Those in required roles are indicated as critical, while those in an optional role are not. !!!

Flying Hours, Quick Setup These instructions will get your Flying Hour Plan (FHP) setup quickly to allow you time later on to become more familiar with other advanced features not addressed here. For many units, this quick setup may be enough, even long-term. Go to PEX Scheduling > Flying Hours module > Flying Hours tab. In the Flying Hours Account grid, right-click and select Add. In the Flying Hours Account dialog, select the MDS(s) for the account, enter the Allocated Hours, Start Date (usually 1 October), End Date (usually 30 Sep), Version = 1, and give the Account a name (e.g., FY15 F-16 O&M). Click Save. !!! Note Enter the actual start date of the flying account, even if you are already in the midst of execution. PEX will allow you later on to tell it what\u2019s already happened, using the Override Data command. Notice the new account shows up in the grid. Click on it to select it. Notice in the bottom Attrition/ASD grid that the Total Hours have been spread out evenly across the months. Click on any of the Hours cells and a Total Allocated Hours dialog comes up. Change the monthly hours to match your contracted hours with Maintenance for each month, ensuring they still add up to the Total. When done, click Save. A dialog will read: \u201cYou should now go to the Weekly or Monthly view\u2026\u201d Ignore this dialog for the moment and click OK. Back in the Attrition/ASD grid, enter your expected Attrition and ASD for each month. Just before the flight schedulers start building missions that wil be charged to this FHP, have them go to Mission Board > Tools > Pre-Mission Settings > Add Sortie > and set the default FHP to what you just created. This way, when they add missions, the default FHP will already be set. Stress to the flight schedulers that every sortie in PEX should have an FHP selected. Stress to the Ops Desk that every sortie\u2019s FHP should be double-checked after it flies. As crews come back from flying and they fill out their PEX AFTO 781, the sortie flying time will automatically feed this Flying Hours module. If you don\u2019t yet use PEX AFTO 781s, then make sure the Actual Takeoff and Land Times are entered in the Mission Board or Flying Schedule modules Use the Flying Hours > Overview tab > Filter icon (top right) to select a particular FHP of interest. Use the Flying Hours > Daily and Graphs pages to monitor FHP execution. Flying Hours, Advanced First, follow the instructions from the Flying Hours, Quick Setup topic to identify and setup your flying hour accounts. Use these advanced instructions to specify no-fly and surge days. By doing so, PEX will calculate how many sorties and hours you should fly daily to properly execute your flying plan. You can then plan your daily flying in detail by identifying flying periods, times, sortie types, and/or number of sorties. Use the Weekly page for all your work as it displays extra data you will need; use the Monthly page for the bigger picture. Pick the Plan. Go to Flying Hours > Weekly page. Select the Flying Hours Settings icon (looks like a funnel) at top-right. Filter down to the single flying plan you are interested in. Starting from the left, select the desired Wing, Group, Squadron, Period, Budget Activity, MDS, PEC, a single Account and a Version is necessary. Establish the Override Date (if required). If you are already in the midst of a flying plan year, tel PEX what has already been flown on that account. On the Weekly page, right-click on any day and select Override Data. Select the month through which you wish to override data. Enter the flying data (Forecast, Planned, Scheduled, and Actual Sorties and Hours) through the end of that month in the plan. PEX uses these values as historical data. Overrides cannot be done by day, only by month. Click Save to save the override data. Click Cancel to exit the dialog without saving any changes. When the next dialog appears, redistribute the remaining monthly hours as desired. Each overridden day will display Data Overridden on the Weekly and Monthly views. You can delete an Override from the Flying Hours Override dialog by clicking on the Delete button. After overriding data, notice your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. Establish the No-Fly Dates. Tell PEX the dates you don\u2019t plan to fly so it wil take those dates out of the calculation. Right-click on any day and select No Fly Days. Select your no fly days and click Save. At the top of the grid are some choices which help you select multiple days easily. For instance, if you choose Sunday then all Sundays will be marked as no-fly. You could then click on any individual Sunday to set it back to a fly day. Or you could choose Federal Holidays and all Federal Holidays will be marked as no-fly. Notice that your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. !!! Note When required, No-Fly Days can quickly be set back to Fly Days (and vice-versa) by right- clicking on the day (in the Weekly view) and selecting the Set as No Fly Day or Set as Fly Day. When you do, notice your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. Establish your Surge or Minimum Fly (Locked) Dates. Tell PEX the dates you want to fly more or less than usual so it can use the information when calculating the required sorties/hours (Calc). Right-click on the desired date and select Change Sorties/Hours. Enter the number of sorties and hours you expect to schedule that day. After the values are entered, a lock will appear on that day. Later, when you re-calculate, PEX will use these manually entered values minus attrition for what you can expect to accomplish for that date. (This is how you tell PEX what you are going to schedule for a given day, instead of PEX recommending what you should schedule.) Notice that your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. Calculate the Plan. On the Weekly page, when the Calc numbers are red, this indicates the numbers are not valid and they need to be re-calculated for the changes you have made. To re-calculate your sorties/hours, first decide on a date from which to reflow the Calculated Hours. If your Flying Plan start date is in the future, you would choose the start date. If your start date is already in the past, you would normal y choose a date in the future (possibly/probably the first of next month), thereby leaving the already agreed upon sorties/hours the same up until the date you select. !!! Note On your selected date, right-click and select Calculate Plan. PEX will then calculate how many sorties/hours you should plan on a given day, taking into account your monthly contract hours, ASD, attrition, and Locked days. Notice that the Calc numbers are no longer red but are now black, indicating they are valid numbers with which to make scheduling decisions. PEX uses the following logic to calculate the sorties/hours on a given date: PEX takes the monthly Contract hours and increases them to account for the attrition factor. E.g., 1000 monthly Contract hours and 15% attrition. The 1000 hours is increased to 1176.47, so when you lose 15% (176.47), you end up with the 1000 desired hours. (Current Month Only) PEX then subtracts the actual hours you have already flown this month from the remaining hours. E.g., 1176.47 minus 100 actual hours equals 1076.47 left to fly this month. PEX then calculates that you want zero hours on No-Fly Days. PEX then uses the number of hours entered through the Change Sorties/Hours dialog on Changed (Locked) Days and lessens the amount by the monthly expected attrition. PEX then divides the remaining hours (e.g., 1076.47) by the monthly ASD to determine the number of sorties that should be flown that month. E.g., 1076.47 hours and ASD of 1.5 equals 717.6 sorties. PEX then distributes the remaining sorties equally among the remaining flying days in the month. It then multiplies the sorties by the monthly ASD to determine how many hours should be flown each day. Plan Sorties/Hours in Detail. Now that PEX has calculated how many sorties/hours you should plan on any given day in your flying plan, you can specify in more detail how those sorties will be scheduled. Planning the sorties/hours to this level of detail is optional but many units find it helpful for coordination with Maintenance and outside organizations. To plan sorties/hours in detail, right-click on the desired date and select Plan Sorties. In the Planned Sorties dialog, right-click in the grid and select Add. Select a Flying Period from the list and enter a Start Time and End Time for that Flying Period. Select the Sortie Type and enter the Count. Modify the ASD, if required. Repeat, adding Flying Periods and Sorties until the Plan numbers equal (or approximate) the Calc numbers. TTP: Once you have a date completely planned, you can copy it to other dates by right-clicking on the date and selecting Copy Day. Then, select the days and/or dates you want to copy to and select Paste. Update Total Allocated Hours. To add or subtract Total Allocated Hours while executing the Flying Hour Plan, in the Overview page left-click in the bottom row labeled Hours. A new dialog opens and Total Allocated Hours may be overwritten. Clicking off the line re-calculates the monthly Contract hours in that dialog. Clicking Save prompts you to re-calculate the Plan in the Calendar. Copy Accounts. If you have multiple accounts to manage that are very similar in terms of no-fly days, ASDs, attrition, etc., instead of starting from scratch, you can copy an existing account and then make modifications to the new account. Once copied, the only things not modifiable are the account Start Date, End Date, Local/Zulu, and Location. To copy an account, select Flying Hours Tab, Overview page. Select the account, right-click and select Copy Account. Modify the Squadron, Period, BA, PEC, Name (mandatory), Version (mandatory), and MDS as desired. Click Save. Total hours can be modified by clicking on the Hours row in the Attrition/ASD gird after the account is copied. New Version of an Account. Using versions allows you to develop what if.. scenarios. For example, you might need to calculate the number of sorties required with different monthly ASDs. To make another version of an account, right-click on an account and select Create New Version. In the dialog, enter a designation (e.g., B or C) for this version. PEX will copy everything about the original account into the new version. From there, you can modify attrition, ASDs, budgeted hours, and/or planned sorties/hours. Only one version of an account is active at any time. Inactivating all versions of an account inactivates the overall account. When you are done tracking an account, inactivate it so it doesn't show on lists anymore. To Set a Version to Active. Go to Flying Hours tab > Overview click on the account to be set to active under the accounts header. When the \u2018Monthly\u2019 view appears check the \u2018Active Version\u2019 checkbox in the upper left corner. To Set a Version to Inactive. Go to Flying Hours tab > Overview click on the active account (shown in green) to be set to inactive under the accounts header. When the \u2018Monthly\u2019 view appears uncheck the \u2018Active Version\u2019 checkbox in the upper left corner. Delete a Version. From the \u2018Flying Hours\u2019 tab right click and select the \u2018Delete\u2019 button. This wil not delete the overall account, only that version of it. View an Inactivated Account. From the \u2018Flying Hours\u2019 tab click on the funnel icon at the upper right corner of the display and checkmark \u2018Show Inactive Accounts\u2019 and continue the selection process as normal. Delete an Account. To completely delete an account all flying hour versions created for the account to be must be deleted. !!! Note Once sorties have been created and logged against a particular flying hour account and version it is impossible to delete it. Single and Multi-Day Remarks. If desired, Single-Day Remark and Multi-Day Remarks can be set by right-clicking and selecting the appropriate command. These functions wil not work on dates in the past. Multi-Day Remarks are displayed on the Weekly view but not the Monthly. Background Colors. If desired, to highlight a particular day(s), right-click and select Background Color. This function wil not work on dates in the past. Starting Calendar Day. You can tell PEX what day of the week you want the weekly view to start on. For instance, if you want this view to display Monday as the first day of information, right-click on a Monday and select Starting Calendar Day. Flying Hours, Associate Units If your flying organization is an association of Active Duty (AD), National Guard (ANG), and/or Reserve (AFRC) units, this topic details how to setup the PEX Flying Hours module. Let\u2019s say the AD wing develops the overall flying plan for the base. They decide which days to fly and how many sorties to fly each day. After the sorties are flown, depending on whether the pilot and/or aircraft belonged to AD, ANG, or AFRC; the flying hours get charged to AD, ANG, or AFRC. If this is your situation, you need to setup an account for each MAJCOM (AD, ANG, and AFRC) plus an overall base (e.g., Langley AFB) account for them to feed into: 102 On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for the overall base (AD + ANG + AFRC). In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AD + ANG + AFRC. In this base account, identify the overall Expected Attrition, ASD, and monthly contract hours (AD + ANG + AFRC). On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the AD sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AD only. In this AD account, identify the monthly breakout of AD hours. (These are the flying hours that will feed ACC\u2019s Flying Hours Online (FHOL) application.) Adding more detail (Att% or ASD) to this account is optional. On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the ANG sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for ANG only. Adding more detail (monthly breakout of hours, Att%, or ASD) to this account is optional. On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the AFRC sorties. In this account, identify the Total (Allocated) Hours for AFRC only. Adding more detail (monthly breakout of hours, Att%, or ASD) to this account is optional. On the Overview page, right-click on the AD account and select \u201cEdit.\u201d In the \u201cAlso Update\u201d list, select the overall base account created in Step 1. This will feed scheduled/actual sorties/hours from the AD account to the overall base account. Repeat Step 7 using the ANG and AFRC accounts. Have those accounts \u201cAlso Update\u201d the overall base account created in Step 1. In the PEX Mission Board > Tools > Pre-Mission Settings, Set the default Flying Plan to the overall base account created in Step 1. This will default all new sorties to the base flying hours account. After sorties are flown, decide whether they are to be charged to AD, ANG, or AFRC and select the appropriate account in the Mission Board, Sorties grid, Flying Plan column. Use the overall base account to monitor the overall progress of the geographic location and the associated accounts to monitor AD, ANG, or AFRC individually. Flying Hours, Monitor Execution First, pick the Flying Hours Account(s) you are interested in. On the Flying Hours tab > Overview page, click the Flying Hours Settings icon (funnel) at the top-right of the page. Make your selections and narrow down the list of Accounts to just the one(s) you are interested in. Overview Page View Target Hours for the current date View Actual Hours flown to date View Hours Remaining to date View a Progress bar comparing Target Hours to Actual Hours Daily Page (Single Account Only) This page provides a detailed listing of hours and sortie data about a single account. It includes every day in the plan and a running sum of each category. Right-click to export the data to Excel. The day is displayed in either Zulu or Local, depending on your selections when the flying hours account was created. To determine whether your day is displayed in Zulu or Local, return to the overview page, right-click on the account, select Edit and look at the bottom left corner of the Edit dialog. Graphs Page New Graphs page functionality includes: Opening the page in a new, separate window. Colors matched to MAJCOM Flying Hour Program standards. The ability to export the graph as a PDF or image file, image option formats being PNG or SVG. While both PNG and SVG support transparency (the ability to view background through the image), SVG can be scaled to any size. Five different graphs provide data about the flying plan Sorties, Hours (), Attrition, Average Sortie Duration, and Hours (). Attrition. The Attrition graph displays sortie (not hours) attrition. Hours (Line, not Bars). The Contract line on the Hours line graph resets to the Flown value at the end of each month. In other words, if you contracted for 350 hours for the month of October but flew 400, the October contract line would end at 350 but the November contract line would start at 400 hours. The Future Scheduled line on the Hours line graph takes attrition into account. In other words, the display assumes you will lose the specified percentage of the schedule. To attain your flying hour goal, you should schedule enough sorties so the Future Scheduled line ends at the same point as the Contract line. View Summary Data To view a monthly or weekly summary of the progress of your flying plan, go to either the Monthly or Weekly pages and click on the Summary link at the top right of the page. This will open the Summary dialog with data for the month of the date you had selected on the Monthly or Weekly page. The top half of the dialog breaks the month up by week. For each week, and for both Sorties and Hours, PEX displays the Contract, Plan, Sched, Actual and Delta hours for that week (or partial week.) The bottom half of the dialog has three date spans: The Plan through the end of last month The Plan for just this month The Plan through the end of this month. Each date span includes the same data as the top half of the page as well as showing Plan vs Actual for Att Rate, ASD, and Fly Days. Day-to-Day Use When you get so far ahead or behind on flying hours that you need to re-plan: create another version of the account. Do not create a new Account. In that new version, change your planning factors (Allocated Hours, ASD, attrition, no-fly days, surge days, etc.). Then select a date from which to reflow the hours, and recalculate the plan. If you then decide to implement the modified plan, select it as the \"Active Version\" on the Weekly view. By creating another version, you retain your original plan in case you need to reference it later. REMIS- Reconcile your hours REMIS, Setup and Download File The Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) tab allows you to upload a monthly REMIS export file and compare this information with the actual flight times logged in PEX AFTO 781s.

A sortie is considered a match if the following data are the same: MDS, Tail Number, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Land Date/Time, Sorties Flown, Total Landings, and Total Full Stops. If the above data are not the same, PEX will attempt to match sorties and identify discrepancies. PEX will identify a sortie as a Match with Discrepancies if the Tail # and Takeoff Date/Time are exactly the samFor the remaining sorties, PEX will match sorties in the same Tail # with the same Takeoff Date and order them by Takeoff TimPEX will highlight discrepancies in the following areas: MDS, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Landing Date/Time, Hours Flown, Sorties Flown, Total Landing and Total Full Stops. The first thing to do is to match unmatched sorties. View unmatched sorties by going to the Unmatched Sorties pagThen: Select a PEX sortie from the Unmatched PEX Sorties grid to display in Selected Sorties Grid Select a REMIS Sortie from the Unmatched REMIS Entries grid to display in Selected Sorties Grid When you have decided these sorties should be matched, right-click on the PEX/REMIS sortie pair and click the Match button To clear a PEX or REMIS sortie from the upper grid, select another sortie To clear both sorties from the upper grid, hit the Clear selections button Once the sorties are matched, they wil move to the Matches with Discrepancies taThere, you can edit PEX sortie data for sorties that have not been AFTO 781 SARM RevieweSorties that have been SARM reviewed are locked from editing and the SARM review must be unsigned before the PEX sortie data can be edited.

Setup Pre-Sortie Crew Rest Right-click in the grid and select Add. Select the MDS, the Crew Position (select the letter indicator in the column of the crew position code that your activity uses. For example, for an F-16 Pilot, select MDS of F-16C and P in the D2 Column. (The D columns are the five Sortie Duty Position characters.) Under Pre Crew Rest, enter the number of hours required for Pre-Sortie Crew Rest and whether you want the crew rest added automatically when the person is scheduled on the first sortie of the day. Setup Post-Sortie Crew Rest On the same line as Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, under Post Crew Rest, enter the number of hours required for Post-Sortie Crew Rest, if any. This crew rest will not add automatically. Setup Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule Click the Alternative Crew Rest checkbox. This is all you need to do. This is an alternative to only the Post-Sortie Crew Rest. It does not affect the Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, already established. The implementation is automatic when: The sortie duration exceeds 16.0 hours. The Mission Status - TDY checkbox is checked for the sortie Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule commitments have a duration of 1/3 of the sortie duration, not to exceed 96 hours. The generated commitment begins one minute after Scheduled Post Sortie End to prevent display of conflicts between the Post Sortie End and the Post Crew Rest Start. The commitment\u2019s start and end times are adjusted when the schedule is changed, as wel as when Actual times are entered. Once generated, the commitment is not deleted if the duration drops below 16.1 flying hours. The scheduler must remove personnel from the sortie or use the crew details dialog to delete post crew rest commitments. Duration of Post-Mission Crew Rest is calculated in hours and rounded to the tenths, e.g., a 26-hour sortie generates an 8.7 hour commitment. To use this feature for off-station missions, ensure that schedulers enter the mission as a single sortie, where the sortie takeoff time is the takeoff time of the first off-station mission and the sortie land time is the land time of the last off-station mission. FS - Sorties Concept. This page is used to build sorties. It is not used to crew those sorties or to add loads/weapons to those sorties. If you are a flight scheduler, we recommend you do not use this Sorties page. Instead, use the WinPEX-only Mission Board to build your sorties. Then, come back to the Flying Schedule module to crew the sorties and to add loads/weapons. The Mission Board has much more sortie building functionality than this Sorties page. If for some reason, the Mission Board is not available to you, the following instructions explain how to use the less functional Sorties page. Setup the Sorties page First, hide all the columns that aren\u2019t required: right-click in the header row just below the Date to invoke a context menu, select Grid Settings. At least one mission must be available to invoke the context menu. Click the buttons in the \u201ceye\u201d column that are required, un-check those not required. The Squadrons/Calendar selection grid on left may be hidden by clicking the left-pointing arrow next to \u201cSquadrons\u201d, affording a full Sorties Board view. Second, configure column order: click-and-drag the column header and drop to desired placement. Third, and importantly, save these changes by right-click select Save Settings. Click Settings> User Preferences. Show cancelled sorties, when checked, the sortie grid displays cancelled missions. These sorties are designated with a strike-through. Click Settings> Squadron Preferences. These apply to all users in the squadron. Create mission as RPA mission, when checked, all missions for that squadron are created as RPA missions and are configurable on the RPA schedule. !!! Note RPA missions are not displayed on the Crew page and therefore cannot be crewed in Flying Schedule module. You must use the RPA Schedule module to add crew. Difference between a Mission and a Sortie A mission consists of one or more sorties. A mission always has at least one sortie. A mission could be a trip with multiple segments (sorties). A mission could also be a formation, where all the sorties belong together. Add a single sortie Click Add Mission and a new line will be generated to enter sortie data. Fill in as many fields as possible. Come back later and fill in the remaining fields as the data is known. Add a formation Click Add Formation to open a dialog where formation information can be added, previewed and edited prior to adding it to the schedule. The data entered will display for all sorties in that formation. Fill in as many fields as possible. Come back later and fill in the remaining fields as the data is known. Add a sortie to an existing mission or formation Click on the mission or formation. Click Add Mission> Add Sortie to Msn/Formation. This adds a sortie to an existing mission or formation. If a mission, the new sortie\u2019s takeoff time wil be one minute after the previous sortie\u2019s land time. If a formation, the new sortie will assume the settings of the formation\u2019s existing sorties. Copy an existing mission to another day Multiple missions may be duplicated to multiple days within a user-selected period of time. To replicate, select Replicate Mission. When the dialog opens, select a squadron and date. When the missions appear, select the source mission or missions. Select which data is to be replicated and the date (or dates) for your target missions. You can choose to replicate missions by days of the week within a date span, and by specific dates. Preview your missions with the Add to Preview button. In Preview, mission numbers and start date/time may be edited. Missions can be removed from preview if no longer desired. Click OK to create the mission(s) and close the dialog, Cancel to abort, or Apply to create the mission(s) and keep the dialog open. Enter actual takeoff and land times Double-clicking in the Actual Takeoff and Land Time fields fills them in with current time. To set a different time, select Actions> Adjust Actuals. If you\u2019re entering actual times from a previous day, you must select to show both the actual date and time columns. When you adjust actual, you have to set both the date and time. Enter the takeoff time first then the land time. What\u2019s the difference between deleting a mission and cancelling it? Deleting missions removes them from PEX. Cancelling missions leaves them in PEX but removes all the associated personnel and location commitments. Before going firm on a schedule, delete the mission. After going firm, cancel the mission so it can be tracked historically. Delete missions Delete Mission allows you to delete missions individually or multiple missions simultaneously. To delete a single mission, highlight the mission, right-click and select Delete Mission. For multiple missions, a dialog appears allowing you to select missions within a specified date range. Missions created from the replicate process display \"Source Mission\" information. Missions that were created from scratch will not show any source mission information. Sorties can be deleted from a mission and, if no sorties remain, the mission will be deleted. Missions committed (firm) in the Mission Board cannot be deleted here. Cancel missions From Actions drop-down, Cancel Mission and Cancel Sortie allow you to cancel missions or sorties. To see canceled sorties, click Settings (gear icon), User Preferences, Show cancelled sorties; the cancelled sortie(s) will display with strike-through. To uncancel a sortie, highlight the sortie, right-click and select Uncancel Sortie. Committed (firm) Missions can be canceled but not deleted. If a committed mission with multiple sorties is cancelled, sorties may be uncanceled individually. An entire mission cannot be uncanceled. Use all the different page controls Squadrons Selects which squadrons\u2019 missions/sorties are displayed. Select any combination of squadrons by holding the Ctrl key while clicking. !!! Note if two or more squadrons are selected for display, Add Mission and Delete Mission are disabled. Calendar Zulu: When selected, the sortie times are based on Zulu. Also, it allows editing dates and times in Zulu but not Local. Local: When selected, the sortie times are based on Local. Also, it allows editing dates and times in Local but not Zulu. !!! Note Local date is determined by the user's location set in the Users & Permissions module. Start/End Date/Time: Defines the time span in which to display missions/sorties. Load Sorties: Refreshes the sortie display after changing squadron or dates. Page refresh: (counter-clockwise-open-arrows) Refreshes the page. Pin page (thumbtack icon): Any of the four Flying Schedule pages (Sorties, Crew, Loads, or Setup) may be \u201cpinned\u2019 to open first. This is a user preference. Date Display: Displays date or date span as selected in the Calendar control, in both normal and Julian formats. Arrow keys allow movement of the date or, if selected, a date span. If a date span is displayed, the span retains the selected number of days. Legend: Displays a legend describing the color lines used to detail sorties. FS - Crew Concept. The main purpose of the Crew tab is to schedule people onto sorties. Use the Mission Board to build the sorties, then come here to crew the sorties. A secondary purpose is to schedule people for non-sortie duties, such as meetings and training. Setup the Crew tab Set either a Five-Day or One-Day View. To switch to a One-Day View, right-click on the desired day below any existing sorties (in blank area) to invoke Expand Day and click it. To toggle back to Five-Day, right-click and click Collapse Day. Choose which Sortie data to display by clicking the Page Settings icon at top-right (white box with green arrow). Go to Setup> Five-Day View. The Five Day View Settings dialog will open. Select either 1 or 2 Row option, then drag/drop your desired Sortie data columns into Table Columns and order them by drag-and-drop. Click OK. The One-Day View is configured separately using the same procedure. Choose which Commitment Types to show below the Sorties. This is done from the same Five-Day or One-Day View Settings dialog launched from Page Settings. Simply check desired \u201cMultiple Commitment Types Shown\u201d and \u201cSingle Commitment Type Shown\u201d. Most units select Leave/TDY for the Single Commitment Type in order to break out these long-term commitments from the daily meetings and training. Click OK. !!! Note We recommend not selecting the Mission and Sortie commitment types because they already display above in the Sortie list. Display a Crew list by selecting an existing personnel filter or creating a new one. Create a new filter by clicking the \u201cfunnel\u201d icon, upper-left in the Crew grid. Clear the filter by clicking the red X. !!! Caution When using the Flying Schedule Crew tab to schedule personnel onto sorties, you wil experience faster performance by filtering the Crew List to as few people as possible. With a Crew List of about 30 people you will experience satisfactory speed. With a Crew List of over 200 people it will take three to four times longer to crew a sortie. If you experience performance outside these parameters, please contact the PEX Help Desk. Configure the Crew List to show or hide Availability, Squadron, Stan Eval, and/or RAP: From the Page Settings icon select Setup, then check/un-check from the menu (below Five-Day and One-Day options). !!! Note Hiding the Stan Eval and RAP columns will increase the speed of this page. Pick the sorties to work on You can see only one squadron\u2019s sorties at a time. You can see people from multiple squadrons in the Crew List area but in the Sorties area, it\u2019s one squadron at a time. Use the squadron selector above the Crew List to pick the squadron sorties you want to see. Next, select either Z or L, depending on whether you normal y schedule in Zulu or Local. Finally, select the date that you want your five-day view to start on. Schedule crew members onto sorties Click on the \u201cCheck Schedule Report\u201d icon at the top of the Crew List (green checkmark). This report identifies scheduling priorities for the selected time frame. Move the report to another monitor or print it. The report includes data for all the personnel in the Crew List. Click on a sortie to be crewed. Notice the crew list now displays information about each person. Referring to the legend, you can tell if the person is overdue for training, on DNIF, on a Restriction, on Supervised Status, already committed, in the zone for an evaluation, and/or their RAP count. Using the information from the Check Schedule report for priorities, schedule a person onto the sortie by drag-and-drop from the Crew List to the Sortie. When your sorties are all crewed, run the Check Schedule report again to see any missed priorities. To remove someone from a sortie, click on the name and drag it back to the Crew List. You can also drag a person from one sortie to another. You cannot drag a person from a sortie to a commitment below or from a commitment to a sortie. !!! Note When a person is selected in the Crew List, the name is highlighted everywhere it appears. This wil help you view a person\u2019s weekly schedule at a glance. This is useful for spotting tight turn times between finishing night duty and starting morning duty. !!! Note If a person is dragged onto a sortie that creates a conflict with another commitment, a Conflict Dialog will display. This dialog will enable you to \u201cSchedule\u201d the person anyway or to \u201cCancel,\u201d which does not put the person on the sortie. Enter flight authorization and 781 data for the crew Once the crew is scheduled, right-click on the sortie and select Crew Details. This Crew Details dialog allows you to order the crew by drag-and-drop. It is also the place to fill in the details of Duty Position, Crew Codes, etc. that populate the flight authorization and AFTO 781. The crew member at the top of the list is considered the Aircraft Commander and will be able to sign off the PEX AFTO 781 Pilot review. To designate the aircraft commander formally for the AF Form4327a, set the first Crew Code to \u201cA\u201d. Hide Tail Numbers for No-Go personnel In the Mission Board> Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences, check the Auto No-Go box. This automatically checks the manual No-Go box for anyone added to a sortie. When the manual No-Go box is checked for any person on the crew, the sortie\u2019s tail number will not be visible to anyone on the crew on the Mission Board, Squadron Daily Schedule, or any Scheduling report. Back on the Crew tab, once someone verifies a crewmember is good to go, go to the Crew Details dialog and manually uncheck the No-Go box. Once all crew members on the sortie are unchecked, the tail number will display. !!! Note This manual checkbox is not tied at all to the automatic Go/No-Go page in PEX. Add Crew Rest In the Crew Details dialog, if the Crew Rest and Post Crew Rest columns are not visible, right-click and select Grid Settings. Check the box next to them and click OK. You can setup PEX to auto-add Pre-Sortie Crew Rest. This Crew Details dialog is where you can manually add Post-Sortie Crew Rest. !!! Note To add Post-Sortie Crew Rest automatically using the 1-to-3 rule, refer to the instructions at PEX Help> Scheduling> Flying Schedule \u2013 Setup> \u201csetup Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule\u201d. Build and use Crew Templates A Crew Template is a grouping of crew positions, e.g., two pilots, one navigator, two loadmasters (P, P, N, L, L). To create a Crew Template, right-click on a sortie which has been crewed with the desired crew makeup. Right-click and select Save As: Crew Template. Provide the template a Name, e.g., \u201cOverwater Nav Crew.\u201d Description is optional. To apply a Template to a Sortie, select the Crew Set tab at lower-left, and drag/drop the Crew Template Name to the sortie. To view the crew positions on a Crew Template, click the \u201c+\u201d icon. To fil the template with actual people, use the Crew tab and drag/drop. Build and use Hard Crews (Crew Set) A Crew Set is a group of specific people (not crew positions). To create a Crew Set, right-click on a sortie which has been crewed and select Save As: Crew Set. Provide the crew set a Name, e.g., \u201cR-21\u201d. Description is optional. To schedule a hard crew to a sortie, select the Crew Set tab at lower-left, and drag/drop the Crew Set Name to the sortie. To view people on a Crew Set, click the \u201c+\u201d icon. Schedule ground commitments from here To add a new commitment. While holding down the Ctrl key, drag a person from the Crew List to the Commitment area at lower-right to the desired day. Release the mouse button while still holding the Ctrl key. A Commitment dialog for the person wil appear. Enter the commitment data, click off the row to save, and close the dialog. The commitment will appear on the Crew tab. If it does not, you have probably chosen to not see this type of commitment. To make it show up, go to Page Settings (upper-right icon) and check the desired \u201cMultiple Commitment Types Shown\u201d. To add a person to an existing commitment. Drag-and-drop the person from the Crew List onto the commitment. You can build shell commitments, such as Alert, Duty Officer, or SOF on the Commitments Board, then use the Crew tab to fil the commitments.- To remove a person from a commitment. Drag-and-drop the person\u2019s name from the commitment back to the Crew List. When you drag the last person off a commitment, you wil be asked if you want the entire commitment deleted. You may want to leave the commitment in place to be filled by someone else later. Schedule an evaluation. The person must have an open evaluation in Stan Eval Management and be scheduled on a sortie. Right-click on the sortie and, in the context menu, click Crew Details. On the evaluatee's details row, click on the field in the Evaluation column and view all open evaluations for that person. Select the desired evaluation and click OK. The scheduled evaluation now appears in Stan Eval Management > Eval Details and the evaluatee's My Page under the Stan/Eval section. FS - Loads Concept. The purpose of the Loads page is to schedule loads (weapons, ammunition, chaff, flares, cargo, etc.) on the sortie. The sorties are created in the Mission Board, then come here to schedule the loads on those sorties. Loads can be assigned individually to a sortie or as part of a set (SCL \u2013 Standard Configuration Load). Setup the Loads tab There is no setup to be done on the Loads tab itself. Go to another module, the Weapons module, to identify your MDS stations, load items, and build your SCLs. Assign an individual load item to a sortie In the grid on the left, select the Loads tab (at the bottom of the grid.) Select a Category of load. Then, click on the sortie you wish to assign the load. At the bottom, the Stations Grid will populate with available stations for the MDS assigned the sortie. Finally, click the desired Load Item, and drag it to the desired station (not to the upper sorties area). Assign an SCL to a sortie In the grid on the left, select the SCLs tab (at the bottom of the grid.) (!!! Note ensure \u201cReq SCL\u201d is selected to display in the Sortie column header, configured from Crew page, Page Settings, Five-Day and/or One day View.) Click the desired SCL and drag it to the target Sortie (not to the bottom Stations area). The SCL name will display in the \u201cReq SCL\u201d column on the sortie grid. (!!! Note When building SCLs in the Weapons module, we recommend, in addition to listing every named station on the aircraft, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares; if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them. Auto-build an SCL number from individual load items Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which in PEX is called Load Code. For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading of 2500 rounds of code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. To use Load Codes in PEX, do the following: Use only a single station on the sortie. Call it whatever you like, \u201cSortie\u201d would be fine. Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them. PEX will generate the Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board. Page Controls Squadron: Selects which squadron's missions/sorties and ground commitments are displayed. MDS: Selects which sorties, by MDS, are displayed. Only sorties that are assigned this MDS will display so if you have sorties that do not have an MDS assigned they will not show up or if you have sorties with a different MDS assigned, you wil need to change the MDS selection to view them. Local/Zulu: Selects whether the missions/sorties displayed for a given date are for that local date or Zulu date. Local date is determined by the user's location set in the Users & Permissions module. Calendar Control: The double arrows move the display five days at a time. The single arrow moves the display one day at a time. The calendar icon brings up a control that will allow you to select any date. Last Updated Time: The last time sortie data was updated. Formation Replication: This is the icon with the capital F located at the top right of the loads grid. When selected it has a down arrow beside it to indicate activation. When activated, any changes made to lead\u2019s load/SCL will be replicated to the wingmen in the formation. Celestial Data: Sunrise/Sunset, Moonrise/Moonset, and Percent Moon Illumination are calculated based on the user's location's latitude/longitude and date. Right-Click on a Sortie Functions: Edit Munition Proj #: When selected, a dialog opens allowing you to select a Munitions Project Number for the sortie. Clear All Load Items: When selected, clears all loads from the sortie. Expand Day: Right-click on a day when in Five-Day view, select Expand Day and it expands the display to show the One-Day View. Collapse Day: Right-click on a day when in One-Day view, select Collapse Day and it collapses the display to show the Five-Day View. Right-Click on a Station Functions: Delete Load Item: When selected, the load item wil be deleted. Add Station: When selected, adds a new station to the end of your list of stations cal ed New Station. You can rename the station and otherwise use it as you would any other station. This allows you to account for a tail number that has an extra station. Delete Station: When selected, deletes the station you right clicked in, along with any loads on the station. Clear Station Load Items: When selected, all load items on the station wil be deleted. FS - ICBM Schedule Concept. The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Schedule page is used to develop an alert schedule for up to two months. These alerts take place at various locations. Each alert mission comprises three phases: Alert, Travel (leaving from the location), and Off Days. The length of each phase is 24 hours but can be modified. What logic does PEX use to build the alert schedule? PEX will auto-schedule personnel onto alert missions using the following rules: The alert schedule can be generated for 62 days max The alert is manned with an MCCC (Mission Commander). Additional crew members can be MCCCs or DMCCCs (Deputy Mission Commanders) If you check the box Create Schedule with Incomplete Manning (recommended) and an MCCC is not available, PEX will build the schedule without an MCCC If you don\u2019t check the box Create Schedule with Incomplete Manning and an MCCC is not available, PEX wil not build the schedule If a person\u2019s crew position is not MCCC or DMCCC, the person wil not be scheduled If a person's Max Alerts per Month = 0, the person wil not be scheduled If a person has another commitment on a day, the person wil not be scheduled If the alert location requires a specific certification, the crew must have that certification with a status of \"Is Certified\" A person cannot be scheduled for more than his/her established Max Alerts per Month If a person's Max Alerts per Month is equal to 1 or 2, that person is not scheduled for an Alert sortie that falls on Saturday or Sunday. Travel and Off Days can fall on the weekend but not the Alert. People with the same crew number sit alert together, when able If a location specifies a Flight, crew from that flight sit alert together, when able Available personnel are randomized, so the A\u2019s don't always end up manning the 1st of the month Available personnel are weighted, so those who got fewer alerts \"last period\" have a greater probability of getting an alert this period Set this up Maintenance> Aircraft: Ensure an MDS of LGM-30G is listed Setup> Squadrons: Ensure LGM-30G is selected for Show in Dropdown Setup> Validation> expand Scheduling> expand Mission Board> click on Sortie Type. Right-click Add new Sortie Types: Alert, Off, and Travel. See figure below for example: Setup> Personnel> Setup tab> select Crew Number. On the Listings grid, right click and select Add. Add the Crew Numbers specific to your unit. In the same area, select Crew Position. In the Listings grid, right-click and select Add. Add DMCCC and MCCC. In the same area, select Flight. Add the Flights specific to your unit. Switch to the Quals tab, select a shortname, set each person\u2019s primary MDS, Qual Code, Crew Pos, and MAJCOM Quals (if used). See sample below: Switch to the Personnel tab, right-click and select Grid Settings. Set your grid settings as follows and save: Records per page: 350 Grid Columns: Select the Unselect ALL button, then check the following boxes: Short Name Name Last Name First Name Middle Flight Aircrew Qual Code CP Crew Number Max Alerts / Month Still on Personnel tab, for each person that has Crew Position of DMCCC-A or MCCC-A, set the following: Crew Number (Optional) Flight (Optional) Max Alerts / Month (Required): Set any number from 0 (min) \u2013 31 (max).

In the Selection Criteria area, select Source as PEX, select the Type of Silo, then select Display data. Right-click, select ADD, and enter all your silo location names, e.g., \u201cA10_1010_MALM\u201d. Ops> Letter of X. Assign your personnel their certifications and set status to \u201cis certified\u201d. If required for a certain alert location, PEX will look for these certifications when the schedule is generated. In WinPEX (not ePEX)> Scheduling> Mission Board> Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Add Sortie Tab> Set MDS to LGM-30G. Switch to the Add Sortie Events tab. Set the T/O Location to PEX and your base location (not a silo location). Select OK to save the pre-mission settings. all ICBM schedulers should perform this user preference step. Generate the alert schedule Navigate to Scheduling> Flying Schedule> Sorties tab. Click the ICBM Schedule icon in the top Tool bar. The ICBM Auto Schedule dialog opens. Fill in the data similar to the following figure: Click Create Schedule. When complete a log file is generated. Save this slog file. Close the dialog. Once generated, it should look similar to: Pull someone off alert On the Flying Schedule> Crew tab, drag the name off the mission, all three phases (Alert, Travel, and Off). Replace with another name. Delete a mission From the Flying Schedule> Sortie tab, use the Delete Mission Option. Deleting the alert mission(s), deletes all three phases. FS - DMO Concept. The PEX Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) module allows geographically separated PEX units to share scheduling information for the purpose of maximizing training. Local PEX units register with their MAJCOM and this registration allows the local units to see the PEX flying/simulator schedules of other registered units. After seeing their schedules, you can use PEX to send out support requests. Register my squadron Navigate to Setup > Squadrons > MAJCOM Registration tab Click the Register Squadron button In the Register Squadron with MAJCOM dialog, from Info Type drop-down select Scheduling From the squadron drop-down select the squadron to register Enter POC information as required. If your squadron already has POC information entered in the PEX Squadrons module, this information wil be pre-populated here. If the POC for DMO will be different from the one listed, overwrite the data. This will not override the POC information from the squadron page; it will be additional just for DMO. Enter the MAJCOM Name. MAJCOM name wil be pre-populated with the value from the Squadrons module. You can overwrite the information as required. To register a squadron with more than one MAJCOM DMO system, just repeat the process using a different MAJCOM name and MAJCOM URL. The MAJCOM URL wil be sent to you; once you have it, copy/paste into the space provided. Click Save. Clicking Save and New saves the information and clears the form to allow another entry. Clicking \u201cCancel\u201d closes the dialog and no information is saved. Once your squadron is registered, the squadron\u2019s status at MAJCOM wil be \u201cwaiting for approval.\u201d Your MAJCOM will then approve your registration. Syncing of scheduling data is automatic at pre-determined intervals or can be done manually via the Sync to MAJCOM button in the Flying Scheduling > Sorties tab. There is no notification to you that your MAJCOM status has changed. Simply revisit the page or contact your MAJCOM by email or phone if you have any questions. We\u2019re registered. How do we see another unit\u2019s schedule Go to scheduling > Flying schedule > MAJCOM schedule One time, setup your view. Right-click > Grid Settings and select to view DMO Support Requests. Select the eyeball for other columns you want to see and the padlock if you want that column locked to the left side of the grid. Select the registered MAJCOM you wish to view Set the date range you want to view. The filter selections display items that are scheduled. E.g., if you set a date range and don\u2019t see MC-130P in the MDS list, it means none are scheduled for the selected dates. You could load the schedule at this time, but you\u2019ll get all missions/sorties for all registered squadrons. This may be too large a list to be of practical use. Pare it down by using the filter selection controls which will narrow your choices as you select each section. The list of squadrons will depend on the MDSs selected. The list of sortie types wil depend on the squadrons selected. You can Load Sorties any time after you\u2019ve set a date range. After you load the schedule, when you click on a sortie, the support request wil populate under the Msn Support Request at the bottom of page. The POC Information will also display. You can send a request email directly to the POC. Send a support request Click to highlight the desired sortie/formation > DMO Support Request The dialog will contain the Mission Number, Call Sign, and Msn Start/End times. Fill in information pertaining to your request using calendar/time controls and the 250-character window for Mission Scenario. All other blocks are drop-down choices Click Save or Save and Close. After saving the request, you are also able to Send Request Notifications. This tells the POC at the other unit to check PEX. It emails the details of your support request to one/some/al of the registered squadrons. When you select \"Generate Email\" the pre-populated email will appear. Proofread it and send. Temporarily suspend sending my scheduling data Navigate to Setup > Squadrons > MAJCOM Registration tab Click to highlight the squadron and MAJCOM you wish to deactivate Click the Deactivate Connection button, and select OK at the confirmation dialog. The squadron\u2019s record wil be highlighted grey in the display to indicate suspension. Turn it back on Select your squadron and click the Renew Connection button. The grey background wil go away and the MAJCOM Approval status wil change to Waiting. Once the MAJCOM approves your connection, your scheduling information will be once again shared.","title":"Flying Schedule"},{"location":"PEX/Scheduling.html#long-range-schedule","text":"Long Range Schedule Basics Introduction Use the Long Range Schedule (LRS) to: Display a 31-day personnel commitment schedule of your ful -range of Commitment types including shifts, utilizing Personnel filters, Letter of X Certifications and Teams.

For detailed instructions, see Managing Your Shifts.","title":"Long Range Schedule"},{"location":"PEX/Scheduling.html#mission-board","text":"Setup Concept. The Mission Board (MB) is used to build a flying schedule. Individual missions are created as either single sorties, formations, or trips. Airspace sortie events are added here. Once the missions are created in the MB, Crew and Loads are scheduled to those missions in the Flying Schedule module. You can tailor the MB to your flying mission. How do I setup the MB? following are the steps needed to configure the MB for your unique flight scheduling operation. However, you may not need to do them if someone in your office has created a MB template. To find out, go to MB> Tools> Template Manager and see if your office has a template listed. It would normally be named something like \u201c757TS Flight Scheduling\u201d. If so, go ahead and Open it, close the MB, and come back to the MB. If you applied a template, you should skip the steps below. Pick your View, Fighter or Standard. There are two available views. The Standard View (S icon below the menu bar) is for missions requiring a large amount of detailed information regarding sorties, events, and timing. This \u201cS\u201d view is normally used by Airlift, Bombers, Tankers, and other large aircraft. The Fighter View (F icon below the menu bar) is normally used by Fighters and Trainer aircraft. Pick your columns. Go to View> Hide/Unhide Columns and select the columns to display (you need to have a least one selection in each list). Order and size your columns. Drag-and-drop the columns to the order you want by double left clicking on them, holding the column header, and dragging it to the proper location. Size the column by left clicking and holding on the right edge of the column and drag it either right or left to size it appropriately. Set your Add Sortie preferences. Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Add Sortie tab. Select the MDS and Flying Plan to default when you add a sortie. Set your Add Sortie Event preferences. Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Add Sortie Events tab. Select the default takeoff and land locations, crew show time, crew brief time, and crew post-sortie end time. Post-sortie end time is how much time you want to all ow the crew after they land to complete paperwork before you schedule them for something else. Change Takeoff Time preference. Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Change Takeoff Time tab. Tell PEX what to do when you change the takeoff time. We recommend you select Changes Show and Brief Dates/Times by Offset.

This feature is used in our tail number denial process. Auto Sortie Numbering. The \u201cEnable Auto Sortie #/Line #\u201d adds a sortie number and line number to each sortie. Enter the starting Line Number. When you add sorties, PEX wil number them for you. Change Notifications. The \u201cSet Change Notifications\u201d button allows you to select which fields trigger change notification actions. Save your setup as a template for others. To save others in your office the time of setting up their MBs from scratch and to have a standardized view across the office, save your MB as a template. To do so, go to Tools> Template Manager and select Save As. Give the template a name such as \u201c757TS Flight Scheduling.\u201d Build Sorties What\u2019s the difference between a Mission and a Sortie? In PEX, sorties belong to a mission. A mission could have just one sortie, plain and simple, think bombers and tankers. Alternatively, a mission could include multiple sorties, a trip, an aircraft and crew that fly multiple sorties, think airlift. A mission could also be comprised or formation sorties, think fighters and trainers. How do I build a single-sortie mission? Click the \"+ M\" icon on the menu bar. A new line will be generated in the Mission and Sorties grids. In the Mission grid, enter a Mission Number. In the Sorties grid, enter your sortie data. The Sortie times will drive the Mission Times. How do I build a trip mission? Go to Tools> Options and turn off Sorties by Takeoff Date. If you don\u2019t do this, when you add a sortie on a different day, the sortie will \u201cdisappear\u201d to its assigned takeoff date. To build a mission with multiple legs, start by adding a mission with a single sortie as described above. Once the mission is added and the data is added for the first sortie, right-click on that sortie and select Add Sortie to Mission. Once this is done a sortie wil be added with the takeoff time being one minute after the land time of the previous sortie. Also, the takeoff location be set to the land location of the previous sortie. Edit the second sortie data as necessary. To add another sortie, just repeat the process. How do I build a formation mission? Click the \"+ F\" icon on the menu bar. Once you get the Add Formation dialog, enter your data. A field marked with an asterisk \u201c*\u201d is mandatory. The dialog is divided into three areas: Basic Sortie Data, Airspace, and View. The first two areas are self-explanatory. The View grid is useful for adding additional formation data. The crew members and call signs can be entered on \u201cSummary/Crewmembers\u201d page. By clicking on the \u201cOther Formation Data\u201d you can enter other data pertaining to the formation. Once you complete the dialog data entry, click OK to add the formation to the MB. How can I break up a 4-ship into two 2-ships (or vice versa)? Right-click on a sortie and select Move Selected Sortie to Formation. \u201cNew\u201d wil create a new formation. The sortie wil keep the line # and the tail number when moved. How do I copy a sortie, a formation, an entire day, or an entire week? You can replicate a mission or multiple missions to different days using the Replicate Mission(s) function. To replicate a mission, right-click in the Missions grid and select Replicate Mission(s). A dialog will appear that will allow you to select a date range to choose which missions you want to replicate (use the CTRL key to multi-select). Then choose what data you want to replicate. Finally, you can select a date range and add the missions by the day of the week or just a day. Once the missions and dates are selected, click Apply or OK. If you click Apply, the dialog will remain open for more replication. How do I delete a single sortie? Right-click delete. The last sortie in a mission wil not delete. You need to delete the mission in this case. How do I delete a mission? Show the Mission grid if it\u2019s hidden (the M icon with a red slash). To delete a single mission, highlight the mission, right-click and select Delete Mission. To delete multiple missions, right-click in the Missions grid and select Delete Missions. . A dialog will appear that allows you to select missions within a specified date range. Missions that were created from the replication process display Source Mission information. Missions that were created from scratch will not show any source mission information. !!! NOTE once a mission has been committed, it cannot be deleted, only canceled. Mission Events What are Mission Events? Mission Events are action items associated to the mission. Example mission events are: Coordinate PPR, Submit ICAO Flight Plan, Mobility Processing, briefings, etc. Mission Events are a good place to track these things. How do I add a Mission Event? Place the cursor in the Mission Events grid, right-click and select Add Mission Event. A line will be generated to enter the event. How do I delete a Mission Event? Right-click on it and select Delete Mission Event. How do I add a group of Mission Events? Mission Event Sets are useful when the same mission events are used repeatedly with maybe only the dates changing. Using a Mission Event Set you don\u2019t have to build the profile from scratch each time, only the first time. Subsequently, you can simply add a Mission Event Set to a mission and identify a new base date. all the other dates wil adjust accordingly. How do I create a Mission Event Set? Enter the individual events in the Mission Events grid with dates and then right-click and select Save Mission Event Set. A dialog box will appear asking for a name and description for the set. When completed, the set will be saved and the set name will appear in the Available Mission Event Sets grid on the Mission Events Builder tab. How do I add a Mission Event Set to a mission? Highlight the desired mission and select the Mission Events Builder tab. Highlight the set in the Available Mission Event Sets grid and click the Add Set to Mission button. A dialog will appear requesting a date to offset. All the events will offset from that date. A dialog will appear asking what to do about existing Mission Events, always select Yes. How do I clear all Mission Events? Click Clear Mission Events. This deletes all mission events except Show and Post Mission End. How can I freeze a Mission Event date/time? Click Freeze/Unfreeze Date/Time. Freezing a date/time prevents cascade options from taking effect. Frozen date/times are displayed with a blue background. Sortie Events What are Sortie Events? Sortie Events are defined as a group of events that will be accomplished just before, during, and after the sortie. When you add a sortie in PEX, it comes with five standard sortie events: Show, Brief T/O, Land, and Post Sortie End. You can add others such as: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, Area Entry, and Area Exit. Sortie events can be added in the Standard view on the Mission Builder or by clicking on the Sortie Events tab. The Sortie Events grid or tab displays sortie events assigned to the highlighted sortie. Sortie events can be assigned individually or as a set to a selected sortie. How do I add individual sortie events? Right-click in the Sortie Events grid and select Add Sortie Event. A new line wil be generated to enter the event. How do I delete an individual sortie event? Right-click on it and select Delete Sortie Event. What are Sortie Event Sets? Sortie Event Sets are useful when the same sortie profile is flown repeatedly with maybe only the times/dates changing. You don\u2019t have to build the sortie profile from scratch each time, only the first time. Subsequently, you can simply add a Sortie Event set to a sortie and identify a new base time. All the other times will be adjusted accordingly. How do I build a Sortie Event Set? Enter the individual events in the Sortie Events grid or the Sortie Events Builder tab with dates and times and then right-click in the grid and select, Save Sortie Event Set. A dialog box will appear asking for a name and description for the set. When completed, the set will be saved and the set name will appear in the Available Sortie Event Sets grid on the Sortie Events Builder tab. How do I use a Sortie Event Set? To add a set to a sortie in the Sortie Events Builder tab, highlight the set and click the Add Set to Sortie button. A dialog will appear requesting a date and time to offset. All the other sortie events will offset from that date and time. Once you set the times and click \u201cOK\u201d another dialog will appear that says \u201cSome events in the set already exist in the Sortie\u201d. You have three options but we recommend that you use \u201cYes\u201d which wil replace all the sortie events. How can I use a Sortie Event Set and still retain my original ARCT data? When PEX sees an ARCT sortie event on your original sortie, the Add Set to Sortie dialog wil come up with the Sortie Event Set ARCT event pre-selected and the checkbox \"Retain Original ARCT Data\" deselected. If you want to apply your standard routing and retain the ARCT and associated (altitudes, call signs, etc.) then all you have to do is select the \u201cRetain Original ARCT Data\u201d and click OK. How do I delete a Sortie Event Set? Right-click on it and select Delete Sortie Event Set. How do I clear the sortie events off a sortie? Right-click on the sortie and select Clear Sortie Events on the Mission Builder/Standard View or the Sortie Events Builder tab. This deletes all except Show, Brief, Takeoff, Land, and Post Sortie End. How do I freeze sortie event times so they don\u2019t change? Right-click Freeze/Unfreeze Date/Time. Freezing a date/time prevents cascade options from taking effect. Frozen date/times are displayed with a blue background. Checking the CT box wil do the same. Schedule AR Tracks How do I schedule Air Refueling (AR)? Use Sortie Events to schedule the AR. In every case, enter the pertinent AR data (Cal Sign, Onload, Altitude, etc.) on the ARCP sortie event. AR Track Duration is calculated between the ARCP time and AREX time. In the case of a Reverse Track, enter the pertinent AR data on the first ARCP sortie event of the sequence and the Track Duration is calculated between the first ARCP and the final AR point in the sequence. There are four options for scheduling AR. Use the one that best suits your mission: Simple. Schedule just an ARCP sortie event. Standard. Schedule ARIP, ARCP, and AREX sortie events. Multiple ARs. Schedule the first one as a standard AR track (ARIP, ARCP, and AREX), insert some other, non-AR, sortie event(s) after the AREX, then add the next AR track (ARIP, ARCP, and AREX). Reverse AR. On the first ARCP sortie event, check the Reverse Track checkbox. Schedule the sequence as either: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP (if the time to the AREX is also scheduled/control ed) ARIP, ARCP, ARIP (if the time to the AREX is not scheduled/control ed) Scheduling Supervisors Concept. PEX allows you to schedule up to three different kinds of squadron supervisors, e.g., SOF, Top 3, and Mobile. You decide as a squadron which three types to schedule. The supervisor schedule is displayed on the Mission Board, Commitments Board, and the scheduling reports. How do I set it up? The first thing to do is to setup your squadron\u2019s Letter of X in PEX so that PEX knows who your supervisors are. Once you have created and assigned the certifications, go to the Mission Board> Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences. In the Supervisor Type area, select one Supervisor Type per line, up to three, e.g., SOF, Mobile, and TOP 3. Then click OK. Now that PEX knows your desired Supervisor Types and who meets those Certifications, you can schedule them. It\u2019s setup. How do I schedule them? To schedule supervisors, go to Mission Board> Tools> Schedule Supervisors. A dialog will appear. Right-click in the grid and select Add Supervisor Commitment. Select a Supervisor Type, then in the Short Name list select the person you want to schedule. Final y, enter the length of the commitment, any remarks, and click on another row to save (if only one row is in view, click on the header to save). Once you have entered all supervisors\u2019 commitments, click OK to close the dialog. To display or check the supervisor\u2019s schedule, click on the Faces\u201d icon on the toolbar. Troubleshooting A supervisor wil not appear in the supervisor drop down for one of three reasons: They are not assigned an \u201cis certified\u201d status in Letter of X They are expired in the respective certification in Letter of X They are \u201cdecertified\u201d with cause in the respective certification in Letter of X Lock Schedule Concept. After the flying schedule is built, you can lock key portions to prevent changes or at least require coordination between Operations and Maintenance before making the change. You can lock one sortie, a day, or a span of days. You can lock Takeoff Time, Land Time, SCL, Aircraft Configuration, MX Line Number, Tail Number, and SCL. Permissions PEXAdmin and squadron administrators. How do I lock the schedule? To lock a day or multiple days at once, display the day(s) you want to lock on the Mission Board, then click the Lock icon on the toolbar. To lock one sortie at a time, right-click on the sortie and select Lock Sortie. !!! Note If you do not have a Tail # or MDS identified in the sortie line, those fields will not lock. Once you add the Tail # or MDS you will have to re-lock the sortie. How do I unlock the schedule? Once a schedule is locked, it can be unlocked only one sortie at a time. Right-click on the sortie and select \"Unlock Sortie.\" Once unlocked, changes can be made and the sortie can be locked again. Track Changes Concept. While working in the MB, changes are not tracked until you \u201cCommit\u201d the mission (go firm). Once committed, when you make a change to a tracked item, PEX allows you to enter details about the change. To identify which items are tracked, go to Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences> Set Change Notifications. Once the tracking data is entered, you can notify the change to personnel. How do I commit missions? Normal y, they should be committed when higher authority approves the schedule. To commit a mission, right-click in the Missions grid and select Commit Mission(s). This allows you to commit all or some missions on a day or a range of days. My missions are committed. What happens now? When you make a change to a tracked field and click off the mission (not just the sortie), PEX launches a change notification dialog where you type in why the change was made. In this dialog, fill in the Authorized By, Description, Item Affected, and Remarks, Effective Date (L), and Effective Time (L) fields. This data wil be sent to recipients and entered on your PEX-generated AF 2407. If you simply want to track this change, click OK. If you want to notify the change, continue reading. How do I notify the change? In the Mission Change dialog, click the Add Mission Crew button, then click OK. This will launch your email with the crew already addressed. Use your email software to add other recipients as desired. When complete, send the email. Can I delete a committed mission? No, once a mission is committed, it cannot be deleted, only canceled. Cancellation may be recorded as a mission change. How do I cancel a mission? To cancel a mission that has been committed, highlight the mission, right-click and select Cancel Mission or check the Cnx box on the Mission line. Once a mission is canceled, all sorties, location, aircraft, and personnel commitment records attached to that mission are cancelled too. Missions that are canceled are not editable except for the Cnx and Msn Cancel Cause columns. If the mission is not canceled, the Msn Cancel Cause field is not editable. How do I un-cancel a mission? Uncheck the Cnx checkbox in the Missions grid. When a mission is uncanceled, all associated sorties will be un-canceled and commitments will be re-engaged for personnel, aircraft, and locations. How do I cancel a single sortie, not the entire mission? Only sorties of committed missions may be cancelled. The cancel sortie checkbox, Cnx, is located in the Sortie grid. Once a sortie has been canceled, all location, aircraft, and personnel commitment records attached to that sortie are cancelled. How do I un-cancel a sortie? Un-cancel a sortie by un-checking the Cnx checkbox in the Sorties grid. When a sortie is un-canceled, all commitments are re-engaged. A sortie can be un-canceled if its mission is not canceled. Tail Number Denial Concept. You can hide aircraft tail numbers from the crew until they are in a \"Go\u201d status. The purpose of this feature is to prevent crew from stepping to the aircraft before accomplishing required items. This is a completely manual process not linked to the PEX Go/No-Go page. How do I set this up? On the MB, go to View> and unselect Show Tail Numbers. On the MB, go to Tools> Options> Squadron, and enable Auto No-Go. When you add people to sorties, PEX will automatically mark their manual No-Go box. How do I use it? Add people to sorties as you normal y would. They come in with the manual No-Go box checked. The sortie tail number is hidden if anyone on the crew is marked No-Go. Verify a person has completed all required actions for proceeding to the aircraft and uncheck their box. For one or two person crews, the box can be unchecked from the MB Sorties grid. For crews of three or more, the box must be unchecked in the Flying Schedule> Crew tab> Crew Details dialog. Only the following permission roles can uncheck the box: Ops Desk, Training Auditor/Arms, Administrator, and Flight Schedulers. When all crew on a sortie have unchecked No-Go boxes, the tail number will display. How does this affect Maintenance? The MX Scheduling permission role has permission to see tail numbers at all times. Export to TAP Concept. This function allows you to export PEX mission data to a file that can be imported by the TBMCS (Theater Battle Management Core Systems) Force Level TAP (Theater Air Planner). Use this function to add missions developed in PEX to the Air Tasking Order (ATO). This function is mostly used by Special Forces. How do I use it? Build your missions/sorties normally in PEX. Enter as much TAP data as you have for the sortie on each of the sortie events you want to export to TAP. Check the Sortie Event \"CT\" block for sortie events with control times. PEX data exported to the TAP file comes from the following fields: TAP FILE FIELD PEX DATABASE FIELD HDR NA. STATIC TEXT \"HDR\" ATO ID NA. TYPE IN FROM PEX - TAP INTERFACE SOURCE APP NA. STATIC TEXT \"PEX\" SOURCE INSTANCE PEX VERSION NUMBER REVISION ID NA. TYPE IN FROM PEX - TAP INTERFACE REVISION DATE/TIME NA. FROM COMPUTER CLOCK (Z) AIRMSN NA.

Note PEX automatically removes dashes from MDSs. E.g., \"MC-130\" will export as \"MC130\". When ready to create the TAP export file, in the PEX MB, select \"Tools, Export to TAP\u2026\" The \"Export to TAP\" dialog will appear. The dialog will display all the same missions/sorties displayed on the Mission Board. Using the \"Export TAP File Location/Name\" browse button, select the location and name to save the file about to be created. (If known) Type in the ATO ID, ACO, and Revision #. Enter your ATO Unit ID and Service. Click \"Save Settings\" to enter this Unit ID and Service for all your missions. Select the missions you want exported to the file. Each PEX mission selected wil generate an \"AIRMSN\" record on the export file. From among the missions you select for export, select the events you want to export. Clicking the \"Show only CT Events\" box wil filter your list down to just events that have control times. Each PEX sortie event selected wil generate a \"TASK\" record on the export file. When you have all the missions and events selected, click \"Export.\" The generated file can be imported by TAP. Distance, Time, and Fuel Concept. The Mission Board, Sortie Events grid displays the exact distance, approximate time, and approximate fuel between event points. It also provides totals of all the above in the Post Sortie End line. These figures provide the scheduler an estimate of fuel required for the sortie. It does not, obviously, replace detailed crew mission planning. How do I set this up? Aircraft Module. In the Aircraft MDS grid, enter the average speed (KTAS) and average fuel flow for the MDS. Fuel flow can be entered as any amount per hour, e.g., pounds per hour or gal ons per hour. Locations Module. Enter latitudes and longitudes for all your flying locations or at least the ones you use frequently. OK, how do I use it? Schedule sortie events the way you normally do, making sure a location is specified. Distance. PEX calculates the great circle distance (NM) between your sortie event points. If an event has no location specified or the location has all zeroes for the lat/long, PEX wil skip over that event and calculate the distance to the next event. Time. PEX divides the distance by the average speed to derive a calculated (approximate) time, then PEX uses the greater of Calculated Time or Scheduled Time. If the Calculated Time between two Sortie Events is less than the Scheduled Time, PEX wil use the Scheduled Time. For example, if PEX calculates it wil take 15 minutes to get somewhere but you schedule 30 minutes, PEX wil use 30 minutes as the time. If the Calculated Time between two Sortie Events is more than the Scheduled Time, PEX uses the Calculated Time. For example, if PEX calculates it will take 15 minutes to get somewhere but you schedule only 10 minutes, PEX wil 15 minutes as the time. Fuel. PEX multiplies the time by the average fuel flow to calculate the approximate fuel (pounds or gal ons depending on how the fuel flow was entered). Use the bottom-line (Post Sortie End) sortie event to get an idea of how much fuel is needed for the sortie. Miscellaneous Deconfliction. As you add people and aircraft to the schedule, PEX compares the mission start date/time and the mission end date/time to other commitments. If there are conflicts, a message box will appear that asks, \"Possible conflicts. Do you still want to add item?\u201d If you select \u201cYes\u201d, the person or aircraft will be added to the schedule. Can I use the MB for display? The Squadron Daily Schedule module was designed as a replacement for using the MB as a flight schedule display. However, if you prefer to use the MB in a Full Screen, Auto-Refresh mode, select File> Ful Screen. While in Ful Screen mode, the record of interest is not indicated by a dark blue line like it normally is, but all MB functionality is available. To exit Ful Screen, hold down the Alt key and hit F twice. Can I use the MB for JTAC Scheduling? Yes, you should. Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) missions could be scheduled using the Commitments Board (CB); however, better functionality is obtained by using the MB. Using the MB, you can copy and paste large Remarks into the Mission Remarks field. With the CB, the Remarks have to be copied one line at a time. Using the MB, you generate a Sortie Details Report on My Page, where your JTAC personnel can see what they are scheduled for and the other personnel on the mission (neither of which is obtained by using the CB). What do the colored names mean? Red indicates overdue a Priority 1 training task (supervision required) Orange indicates manual No-Go Blue indicates both of the above How do I enter actual takeoff and land times? Click on the \u201cclock with an A\u201d icon and the actual time fields wil display in the Sortie grid. If you want to enter the current time, just click in the time field. If you want to change it from current time, click in the field and edit. If the time has already been saved, you will need to right-click on the time field and select \u201cAdjust Actual\u201d then you can change the times. This is to prevent accidental changes. If you click on the field for sorties at least one day in the past it will put scheduled time in the field. Can I filter the list of sorties? Yes, click on the Filter icon. You can filter by MDS, Sortie Type, or both. This is useful if you want to filter out simulators and/or alert sorties. What do the other icons do? M Icon with a slash through it - will hide the Mission grid if you have the Fighter view Selected The M icon with a line up and down - expands the Mission grid in the Standard view The S icon with a line up and down - expands the Sorties grid in the Standard view The S# icon - will re-number your sorties The L# icon - will re-number your line numbers The icon with two heads - displays the Supervisor schedule Custom Flight Schedule This function is no longer available; it has been made obsolete by the Scheduling Reports, especially the Custom Schedule.","title":"Mission Board"},{"location":"PEX/Scheduling.html#personnel-availability","text":"Displaying Personnel Availability Data Select a squadron in the Squadron drop-down list that has scheduled availability periods. Select a person from the Personnel drop-down list. When a person is selected, the Availability grid will display the selected person\u2019s availability data from the database and the date it was last updated. In the Availability grid, ToolTip notations on the Date field will list the day of the week/Julian Scheduling date and ToolTips on the Availability Type code field will list the Availability Type Description. Updating Personnel Availability Electronically This is a three-step process. First, create a Personnel Availability Import File and send it to your personnel. Second, as the files are returned completed, you store them in a folder. Third, when you are ready, import the data. Creating the Personnel Availability Import File. This is a single file that you will send out to your squadron personnel where they can fill in, by month, when and how they are available. The file will automatically include your squadron's Availability Periods and Availability Types. Select \"Tools, Create Import File. .\" to launch the dialog. Then, select the Month/Year for which you want availability entered and click \"Create File.\" The file will automatically be saved to Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Outgoing folder unless you specify otherwise. Now that the file is created, use your Email software to send it to your personnel. The file includes instructions on how to fill it out. Storing Filled-In Import Files. As your personnel return the files filled in with their availability, save them to Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming folder or as desired. Importing Personnel Availability Files. Select the squadron for which you want to import personnel availability data. Then, select \"Tools, Import Availability. .\" to launch the dialog. Click \"Select Files\" to see a list of all the files available for import, these files will normally be located at Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming folder unless you have specified otherwise. Once you have selected your desired files, normally select all of them, click OK. The selected files will be listed and you can then click \"Import.\" Once a file has been successfully read and entered into the PEX database, the file will be automatically renamed \"Imported\" + the original file name. Changes. Personnel can use the same import file to update availability data they previously sent you. They simply re-do their availability for the month and send it to you. You will know they are changing their availability by receipt of a another file for the same month. When you import the updated file, it will delete their previous inputs for the month and replace it with the new. Errors. A log file is created each time files are imported. If personnel make errors filling out the import file, the specific error is listed so you can go into the file and fix it. Any file with errors will remain in the Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming directory until successfully imported. Adding Personnel Availability Data Manually For one or few days: Select the days on the calendar in the Select By Day section and click Add. This wil move the selected day to the Selected Days list box. Or, For many days, use the Select by Days of Week grouping: Set the Date Span inside of which the available days will fall. Select the All Days radio button to set all of the days in the Date Span inside the Selected Days window or select the By Day radio button to set multiple instances of a certain day, and select the check boxes of the days to place in the Selected Days list. Once the days are selected, set period availability by highlighting the days in the Selected Days list. The highlighting may be done individually or all days may be highlighted using the Select all button. The Unselect All button will remove the highlighting from all highlighted days in the list box. Use the Set Availability group to assign availability either All Day or By Period, the periods as Hard or Soft, and the Availability Types. Click Add to send the date(s) and availability to the Availability grid. Select Apply to save the data to the database. !!! Note The meaning of Hard and Soft is unit-defined. E.g., Hard could mean the crewmember will show up for whatever is scheduled without the scheduler double-checking.

You can create shifts for any length of time assigned to a date range. You can create unit specific shift names, shift types, crew compositions, background colors to represent a specific shift types and create and manage shift patterns which support a rotational and recurring shift. Permissions Ground Scheduling, and Administrator: can add/edit/delete shift schedules. Ops Desk, Ops Staff, SOF, Training Admin, Course Admin, CT Admin and Task List Admin: can view but not make changes. Controls Access these procedures by navigating from the PEX main menu to Scheduling > Shift Scheduler. Workspace Shifts and Setup tab: shifts tab displays shifts and allows modification of shifts. The setup tab supports setting up the module for use. Crew Position grid: use filters to bring in a list of personnel based upon crew position. DAFSC grid: use filters to bring in a list of personnel based upon a DAFSC or a certification. Certification grid: use filters to bring in a list of personnel based upon a DAFSC or a certification. Crew and Crew Set tab: crew tab displays the CP, DAFSC and certifications pane. The crew set tab displays crew sets or crew templates built by the scheduler. Workflow Shift Schedule Setup Squadron Management Setup Setup- Personnel module !!!

These are the new schedules, found under Scheduling> Reports. Select the format of the schedule you want, e.g., Fighter Schedule or Bomber Schedule. For Fighter and Trainer units, we recommend the Custom Schedule Report. Start by selecting the date range, time display (local or ZULU) and Only Sorties that Flew (sorties with Actual Takeoff and Land times entered on the Mission Board) as required. Select the Squadron(s) from which you want sorties. Select the MDS(s) you want to appear on the report. Show (Rows) allows you to pick more qualifiers for the data you want to display. Move on to the \"Ground\" tab and select what ground scheduling data (Personnel Commitments) you want to appear on the report. In the \"Show\" area, select whether to even display the \"Ground\" data at all and whether to label the entire schedule as \"SECRET.\" Select the squadron(s) from which you want personnel commitments to appear. Select the Supervisor types from the selected squadrons. Select the Commitment types you want to appear from the selected squadrons. Select \"PDF\" to get a read-only type file or \"Excel\" to get an editable file. Your selections for each schedule (e.g., Fighter or Bomber) are saved as user preferences. Times. \"(L)\" times on the schedule are local times at the location specified, e.g., landing at KHIF at 09:00 (L) is Hill AFB local time. Ground events and the supervisor schedule display the local time of the user logged in based on their location. The celestial data (L) time is also the local time of the PEX user logged in. User locations are set in the Users and Permissions module. Changes in Red. The schedule can show in red, data that has changed since the schedule was committed. To setup this feature, go to the Mission Board, Tools, Options, Squadron Preferences tab, and select the items to track (show in red) if changed. Later, commit the schedule as normal. If any tracked item changes after the commit, it will show in red on the schedule. Certain calculated values (i.e., Pattern Time and AR Track Duration) will never show red, even if they changed. Neither wil the following values show in red: Actual Takeoff Time, Actual Land Time, and a person's Weather Category (\"WX\"). Air Refueling (AR) Data. PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events: ARIP, ARET, ARCP, ARCT, AREX, AREXIT, and ARINFO. If it finds any of them, they wil appear on the schedule. AREX or AREXIT defines the end of a sequence of AR events, e.g., ARIP, ARCP, and AREX would define a single AR sequence. Within an AR sequence, the first supporting data entered against any of the AR events wil show up on the schedule. For example, if you load some of the AR data (Seq #, Alt, Rz Type, for example) on the ARIP line and the rest (Onload, Priority, for example) on the ARCP line, that will work fine. If you load the same type of data, e.g., Seq #, on two different lines within the same sequence, the schedule wil print only the first one. For example, if you enter Sequence Number \"1201\" on the ARIP line and \"1502\" on the ARCP line; it's the \"1201\" that wil show up. Bottom-line, enter the supporting data on any line of the AR sequence but only once. AR track duration is calculated as the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the AREX sortie events. Reverse Track. Define a Reverse AR track in PEX by checking the \u201dReverse Track\u201d box on the first \u201dAREX\u201d sortie event. PEX wil then disregard the second AREX and ARCP times and use the final ARIP time as real AREX time. PEX assumes a reverse AR track has the following sortie events sequence: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP. AR Track duration is the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the final AREX (which is really the geographic ARIP). Airspace and Range Data. The flying schedules (except Custom Schedule) provide options to show airspace/range Name, Entry Time, IP (Initial Point) Time, and/or Exit Time. If you use the Sortie Events Builder tab to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events to populate the following airspace/range data: Entry time: \"LL EP\", \"Area Entry\", and \"ALTN EP\" IP time: \"IP\" (but will display only if followed by LL EX, Area Exit, or ALTN EX) 3) Exit time: \"LL EX\", \"Area Exit\", and \"ALTN EX\" !!! Note If the Entry, IP, and Exit locations are the same (e.g., IR 275), PEX will list the times on one line. If the locations are different (e.g., IR 175 PtA, IR 175 IP, and IR 175 PtZ), PEX will list the times on separate lines. If you use the Mission Builder tab, Sorties grid, Airspace columns to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX include whatever you schedule for airspace/range Start Time and End Time. If you use the Custom Schedule report, the airspace process is simpler and more generic. Any PEX Sortie Event or Airspace that you schedule between the Takeoff and Land times, that has a Location Name specified, wil show up on the report when you select Location, Airspace Entry, or Airspace Exit. Exit/End Time is based on Sortie Event Duration or Airspace End Time. Miscellaneous. If \"IAF\" is entered as a sortie event on the Bomber Schedule, the IAF time wil display on the schedule and \"Pattern Time\" wil calculate as the time between the IAF time and Land time. If \u201dBus\u201d is entered as a sortie event, the \u201dBus\u201d local time will show. Crew will show up in the same order as on the Flying Schedule/Crew module. If the order is not as desired on this report, make the change on the Flying Schedule> Crew tab. If a person is assigned a WX Cat (Personnel> Quals & Certs), the fighter schedule will display the category in parentheses to the right of the crew position. This applies when the person has a MDS qualification matching that scheduled on the sortie. If the MDS is different, the parentheses are empty.

Navigate to Scheduling > Reports > AFSOC 40 tab. Select your desired options and generate the form. You can create templates for the additional comments section of the form. Create as many templates as you need. Where in the PEX does the data pull from? The table below shows where in PEX you enter the information that fills in the form: !!! Note The Mission Board column names are the default ones. Yours may be different. If you can\u2019t find these columns in the Mission Builder, they\u2019ve probably been changed. Go to Setup > Labels > select your squadron. At the \u201cinterfaces\u201d grid highlight Scheduling-Mission Board-Mission Builder, locate the default label text and note the Override Label Text \u2013 this is the column name you\u2019ll see in the mission builder tab. !!! Note To get a \u201cload time\u201d you must first add a specific sortie event. Go to Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Mission Board > Sortie Event, and add \u201cMSN LOAD\u201d (it must be spelled this way). At the Mission Board > Sortie Events Builder > Available Sortie events, you should now see MSN LOAD. Add this sortie event to your sortie and give it a time. It\u2019ll now show up on the AFSOC Form 40. !!! Note To get mission loads they must first be added in the Weapons module, then scheduled on the Flying Schedule > Loads tab. They\u2019ll now show up on the AFSOC Form 40. Flying Schedules How to Use. These are the new schedules, found under \"Scheduling, Reports\" in both ePEX and WinPEX (the screen with the DoD logo): !!! Note When launching the reports in Excel, on the Windows Vista operating system, on the Windows File Download dialog, \"Save\" the report first, do not \"Open\" it directly. Select the format of the schedule you want: Fighter Schedule or Bomber Schedule. Start on the \"Sorties\" tab and select which sorties you want to appear on the schedule: Select the date range and whether you want times displayed in Local or Zulu. Locations with no Zulu Rule or DST Offset entered in the PEX Locations module will also display in Zulu only. Select the squadron(s) from which you want sorties. Select the MDS(s) you want to appear. Pick whether you want Alert, TDY, Cancelled, and/or Spare sorties to appear. (Alert, TDY, and Cancelled are set in the Mission Board in the Missions grid. Spare sorties are created by including \"sp\" anywhere in the Mission Board Line Number field, e.g., \"601sp\".) Select \"Show Only Actual Sorties\" to get an after-action report of what actually flew (sorties with Actual Takeoff and Land times entered on the Mission Board) in actual takeoff order. Select \"BASH Window\" to display the Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazard window of time. This window is setup in the Squadrons module. Finally, in the \"Display\" area, pick the columns you want to appear on the schedule. Move on to the \"Ground\" tab and select what ground scheduling data (Personnel Commitments) you want to appear. In the \"Show\" area, select whether to even display the \"Ground\" data at all and whether to label the entire schedule as \"SECRET.\" Select the squadron(s) from which you want personnel commitments to appear. Final y, select the supervisor types and commitment types you want to appear. Select \"PDF\" to get an Adobe Acrobat read-only type file or \"Excel\" to get Microsoft editable file. Your selections for each schedule (e.g., Fighter or Bomber) are saved as user preferences. Times. \"(L)\" times on the schedule are local times at the location specified, e.g., landing at KHIF at 09:00 ( L) is Hill AFB local time. Ground events and the supervisor schedule display the local time of the user logged in based on their location. The celestial data ( L) time is also the local time of the PEX user logged in. User locations are set in the Users and Permissions module. Changes in Red. The schedule can show in red, data that has changed since the schedule was committed. To setup this feature, go to the Mission Board, Tools, Options, Squadron Preferences tab, and select the items to track (show in red) if changed. Later, commit the schedule as normal. If any tracked item changes after the commit, it will show in red on the schedule. Certain calculated values (i.e., Pattern Time and AR Track Duration) will never show red, even if they changed. Neither will the following values show in red: Actual Takeoff Time, Actual Land Time, and a person's Weather Category (\"WX\"). Air Refueling (AR) Data. PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events: ARIP, ARET, ARCP, ARCT, AREX, AREXIT, and ARINFO. If it finds any of them, they wil appear on the schedule. AREX or AREXIT defines the end of a sequence of AR events, e.g., ARIP, ARCP, and AREX would define a single AR sequence. Within an AR sequence, the first supporting data entered against any of the AR events wil show up on the schedule. For example, if you load some of the AR data (Seq #, Alt, Rz Type, for example) on the ARIP line and the rest (Onload, Priority, for example) on the ARCP line, that will work fine. If you load the same type of data, e.g., Seq #, on two different lines within the same sequence, the schedule will print only the first one. For example, if you enter Sequence Number \"1201\" on the ARIP line and \"1502\" on the ARCP line; it's the \"1201\" that wil show up. Bottom-line, enter the supporting data on any line of the AR sequence but only once. AR track duration is calculated as the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the AREX sortie events. Reverse Track. Define a Reverse AR track in PEX by checking the \u201dReverse Track\u201d box on the first \u201dAREX\u201d sortie event. PEX will then disregard the second AREX and ARCP times and use the final ARIP time as real AREX time. PEX assumes a reverse AR track has the following sortie events sequence: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP. AR Track duration is the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the final AREX (which is really the geographic ARIP). Airspace and Range Data. The flying schedules (except Custom Schedule) provide options to show airspace/range Name, Entry Time, IP (Initial Point) Time, and/or Exit Time. If you use the Sortie Events Builder tab to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events to populate the following airspace/range data: Entry time: \"LL EP\", \"Area Entry\", and \"ALTN EP\" IP time: \"IP\" (but will display only if followed by LL EX, Area Exit, or ALTN EX) 3) Exit time: \"LL EX\", \"Area Exit\", and \"ALTN EX\" !!! Note If the Entry, IP, and Exit locations are the same (e.g., IR 275), PEX wil list the times on one line. If the locations are different (e.g., IR 175 PtA, IR 175 IP, and IR 175 PtZ), PEX will list the times on separate lines. If you use the Mission Builder tab, Sorties grid, Airspace columns to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX include whatever you schedule for airspace/range Start Time and End Time. If you use the Custom Schedule report, the airspace process is simpler and more generic. Any PEX Sortie Event or Airspace that you schedule between the Takeoff and Land times, that has a Location Name specified, wil show up on the report when you select Location, Airspace Entry, or Airspace Exit. Exit/End Time is based on Sortie Event Duration or Airspace End Time. Miscellaneous. If \"IAF\" is entered as a sortie event, the IAF time wil display on the schedule and \"Pattern Time\" will calculate as the time between the IAF time and Land time. If \u201dBus\u201d is entered as a sortie event, the \u201dBus\u201d local time will show up in Remarks. A cancelled sortie will show up with a gray background and \u201dCANX\u201d in the Mission Number field. Crew will show up in the same order as on the Mission Board/Flying Schedule module. If the order is not as desired on this report, make the change on the Mission Board/Flying Schedule module. If a person is assigned a WX Cat (Personnel> Quals & Certs), the fighter schedule will display the category in parentheses to the right of the crew position. This applies when the person has a MDS qualification matching that scheduled on the sortie. If the MDS is different, the parentheses are empty. Bomber Schedule New Prototype. PEX 5.12 includes a prototype for an improved flying schedule report. Please send the Help Desk any feedback you have on this prototype. To make maximum use of this report: In the WinPEX Labels module, at Scheduling \u2013 Mission Board \u2013 Mission Builder, re-label IFF to IFC, OFP, or Block as desired. Use that field on the Mission Board and it will show up on the schedule. Enter all your AR data on the ARCP sortie event line. Personnel Fly Hours Concept. This report is used to provide the total flying hours flown within a 7, 30, 60, and 90 day period, as derived from the Aviation Resources Management System (ARMS), to help ensure personnel do not exceed mandated limits. How do I generate the report? Open the report interface by navigating to Scheduling > Reports > 7/30/60/90 Hours tab. Personnel Tab. Select criteria by starting in the left column, which will narrow down the search as you go left to right.

Schedules can be generated for Missions, Production Request or Events. Currently, data you input into the Scheduler module does not feed into any other part of PEX (e.g., the My Page, Long Range Scheduler module, Shift Schedule or Commitments Board), it does however communicate with the Go/NoGo module. Permissions PEX Administrator and Scheduling Administrator: can build/edit/delete Missions, Events, Production Requests, and can work with ful access within the module. Scheduler Read Only: allows users to view the schedule only. Module Notes The Scheduler module is only accessible in ePEX. To add a location in Scheduler, the location must be established within PEX via the Locations module. Controls The Scheduler is accessed from the PEX navigation panel > Scheduling > Scheduler.

Scheduler Mission - Functions The following describes features and functionality in flying operations events; such as missions and sorties. Features and functionality common to all types of events are covered in Scheduler Functions - Common and Scheduler Functions - Event. Add a Mission !!! Note The difference between a Mission and a Sortie - Sorties belong to a Mission. For example, a Mission could be a four-ship formation (four Sorties), or a three-leg trip (three sorties), or a single-sortie mission. In the Scheduler, you will create the Mission first then add Sorties to it. In the Scheduler module, Sorties are listed in Sub Events. !!! caution Unlike the PEX Mission Board, the scheduler module has no logic to keep the Sorties and Missions synchronized. With this Scheduler module it is not recommended to build Sorties completely outside the date range of the Mission. You should manually synchronize the Mission Start Date/Time with the first Sortie\u2019s Takeoff Date/Time. The Mission End Date/Time should be kept manually synchronized with the last Sortie\u2019s Land Date/Time. Not doing so wil make your schedule difficult to understand. Single-sortie Mission Navigate to the Scheduler module. Click on the drop down arrow, top right side of the screen and select Add Mission. Enter the Mission Number. Select the squadron that owns the Mission. Enter the Mission Takeoff Date/Time as Start Date/Time. Enter the Mission Land Date/Time as the End Date/Time.

Data is shared between systems allowing PEX users access to relevant information. If properly configured and operated, the end result is a reduced reporting burden on the squadrons and enhanced communication to higher headquarters. UC2/EMOC maintains aircraft and aircraft status data. Updated data are exchanged between PEX and UC2, while EMOC can update both PEX and UC2. PEX does not directly update EMOC, although PEX can update UC2 which then flows EMOC. NOTES: In PEX, connectivity is established between these four systems (PEX, UC2, EMOC and TBMCS-FL) in two tabs. Once established however, operations in PEX appear seamless to schedulers. Not all data flows to each program. Typically, an AOR/AOC will have a single TBMCS-FL database, while an individual location may have one UC2 database and multiple PEX databases. GTIMS PEX imports scheduling data from GTIMS and displays the information in the Ops > Waterfall module. CSE CSE is a computerized system for the scheduling of all missions requiring the use of specific ranges or support resources. Scheduling data interfaces outside of the External Interfaces module Two interfaces are not active connections but simple file imports. Users normally download these files from a hosting website. Although the interfaces are not part of this module, the imported data is used throughout PEX scheduling functions. Air Tasking Order (ATO) files (*.ato) are imported into PEX in the Scheduling > ATO module, creating mission shells. These shells can then be edited with local data in the various PEX scheduling modules (Mission Board, Flying Schedule, etc.) Airspace Control Order (ACO) files (*.aco) are imported into PEX in the Setup > TaskView module, creating and/or updating location data in the Setup > Locations module.

Prior to establishing the connections, the Connection Status field is red, and the Status reflects \"...not activated...\" Click Verify Mission Connection. The Connection Status field should turn green, and the Status should reflect \"Connection successfully verified.\" Click Verify Ranges Connection. The Connection Status field should turn green, and the Status should reflect \"Connection successfully verified.\" Consult the CSE Test Logging log files as required. Click Import Ranges To PEX. A pop up informs you CSE Range Import Successful. Consult the CSE Range Import log file as required. The file reflects ranges successfully imported. If this range import is an update, as opposed to the initial import, it may also reflect ranges removed from the PEX database. Map PEX Airspace Locations to CSE Ranges Corresponding airspaces must be added in Setup > Locations before PEX and CSE locations can be mapped. Go to Setup > Resources > Types > Airspace List and view the list of Airspace locations from Setup > Locations. Select an Airspace, and the Airspace Details flyout on the right displays those CSE ranges, if any, currently mapped to the airspace. Each range is considered by PEX to be a \"group\" and will appear as such under the Airspace Details List. In the Airspace Details, click on the pencil icon to edit the ranges mapped to the airspace. This will open the Edit Airspace flyout. To map ranges to the airspace: In the Resource Groups section, select Add to add ranges to the airspace. In the Add Resource Groups flyout, the ranges not yet mapped to the airspace wil be listed. Select the checkboxes for those ranges to be mapped to the airspace. Select Done when all ranges have been selected. This wil return you to the Edit Airspace flyout. Select Save. !!! note Use the type ahead Search box at the top of the Add Resource Groups fly out to filter the list of ranges. To unmap ranges from the airspace: In the Resource Groups section, click on the red box with an X for the airspace to be unmapped. In the Confirmation dialog, select Yes or No as appropriate. Continue clicking on the red boxes until all airspaces to be unmapped have been removed. In the Edit Airspace flyout, select Save. To view all of the ranges mapped to each airspace at one time, in upper right corner of Resources page, select More Options (...). Select Show Groups. To hide the ranges, select More Options (...), then Hide Groups. !!! note Range mapping can be edited. The actual imported ranges cannot be edited. Workflow Schedule missions as normal in the Mission Board. Missions that will be sent to CSE must have at least one Airspace mapped to CSE ranges and a valid Range Project Number (Range Proj#). If these columns are not visible in the Sorties grid, unhide them using the View control. When ready to send range requests to CSE, go to Scheduling > Flying Schedule > Sorties tab. Click the CSE Export button, and the CSE Mission Export page is opened, with the Mission Filter flyout also open. Set filter by Squadron(s), Zulu/Local, Start Date/Time and End Date/Time. You can filter further by MDS and Airspace. Click Load. The CSE Mission Export page opens with all missions meeting your filter criteria. Two slider control options allow you to: Show Sent Missions. !!! note Once a mission is sent to, and accepted by CSE, it cannot be re-sent. Include Sortie Remarks. Sortie remarks (manually entered in the Mission Board > Sortie grid) are sent if this option is selected. NOTES: Mission remarks (manually entered in the Mission Board > Mission grid) are always sent. Range Report information is always sent, if those columns are checked in Mission Board. Available columns are GCI, GUN, JTIDS, LASER, LIVE, NACTS, RFMDS, THREATS and TOSS. Other exported data includes Squadron, Msn #, Cal Sign(s), IFF(s), Airspace and Entry/Exit (L) Times. Check all missions to be sent to CSE. When satisfied, click the Export to. . button, and Yes or No to the confirmation dialog. An Export Result Log dialog opens listing each exported mission. For each, a REJECTED or ACCEPTED BY CSE status is displayed. If rejected, a CSE error code and reason describe the error. Rejected and accepted totals are displayed at bottom. If you need to refer to this log file in the future, go to Setup > External Interfaces > Status tab, and call applicable the log file. In addition to Airspace and Range Project Number, PEX validated in CSE include: Squadron, MDS, Weapon Load Items and Codes, and Complete Round Codes (CRC). For any rejected missions, edit the data as required in the Mission Board or Flying Schedule and re-send. Scheduling Operations Local procedures and command guidance determine when to pass ATO mission scheduling information from PEX to UC2. Communications traffic between the two systems will be minimized the more complete the schedule is before the subscription occurs. !!! note Operational reporting requirements may dictate UC2 subscribing to an ATO before the schedule has been firmed. This is especially likely during periods of around the clock operations. Missions in PEX which are not associated with an ATO are called \u201cLocal Missions\u201d and those missions are passed to UC2 immediately upon creation, if a known MDS has been assigned. The following data enables certain actions: Assigning a mapped MDS to a sortie allows the mission to flow from PEX to UC2. Assigning a Tail number to a PEX sortie allows UC2 RMA to display the ATO SCL. The PEX load sets, SCLs, and Auto generated SCLs are of no interest to UC2 and are not shared. The Mission Number in UC2 allows for only 8 characters; if it is longer than 8 UC2 will not display the mission. The mission type assigned in PEX must be less than seven characters long or UC2 cannot display the type in RMA. When a mission is \u201cCommitted\u201d in PEX, UC2 will interpret that status as \u201cScheduled\u201d. Prior to that action, the UC2 status is \u201cTasked\u201d When the first sortie of a mission has an Actual Time of Departure entered in PEX, UC2 will interpret the mission status as \u201cTake Off\u201d; the earliest ATD will be forwarded to TBMCS-FL asb \u201cMission Actual Start Time\u201d When the last sortie of a mission has an Actual Time of Arrival entered in PEX, UC2 will interpret the mission status as \u201cLanded\u201d and the data will be forwarded to TBMCS-FL as \u201cMission End Time\u201d Maintenance Line numbers are used by EMOC to identify sorties in both UC2 and PEX, and these line numbers must be unique to an ATO period, which usual y does not correlate to a calendar day (Local or Zulu). ATO days can be from, for example, 06:00Z to 05:59Z. !!! note PEX has an \u201cAuto Line Number\u201d function which may result in violating this condition, dependent on the missions displayed, the ATO cycle and unit numbering conventions. Operations and Maintenance personnel must coordinate this process. The following information is displayed in UC2 RMA based on PEX scheduling information: Line number Mission Type (if less than 7 characters) Mission CNX (Cancelled) Assigned Squadron Call sign Flying period (only numeric, not alpha) MDS/Tail Number ATO SCL ATO Secondary SCL The first two crew members (if known to UC2, else UNKNOWN) Sortie Brief time Sortie scheduled and actual takeoff* Sortie takeoff and land location Sortie scheduled and actual landing Sortie CNX Sortie Remarks TTPs PEX permits operations which may or may not be in accordance with AOR operational procedures. For example, cancelling a local (non-ATO) mission through the use of the Mission Board \u201cCNX mission\u201d function would probably be an accepted practice, while performing the same action on an ATO mission would be outside the authority of unit schedulers. ATO missions are typically cancelled through an ATO change. Use of PEX and UC2 does not guarantee all operational directives will be complied with. PEX and UC2 displays wil not necessarily display the same missions, even though both systems contain the same missions. This is because of the use of Zulu versus Local times and various PEX filtering abilities such as \u201cShow Sorties by TO Date\u201d, \u201cFilter By Sortie Type\u201d, and \u201cFilter by MDS\u201d. EMOC can accept only unique line number/ATO date combinations. For example, two line numbers \u201c300\u201d during one ATO cycle wil be a problem even if they are on two different calendar dates. Use of PEX \u201cAuto Line Number\u201d function may result in duplicates which must be resolved manually. EMOC operators can perform a tail number swap between lines and they can enter/modify actual take off and land times on a sortie. If EMOC adds a tail number to a mapped unit and MDS, then UC2 will create the tail number and In PEX you will need to add the new tail number in the Aircraft Module. Then in the UC2 module you wil need to map it to the UC2 tail number. EMOC operators can modify aircraft status and that information will flow through UC2 to PEX. EMOC operators can perform a tail number swap between lines and they can enter/modify actual take off and land times on a sortie. If EMOC adds a tail number to a mapped unit and MDS, then UC2 wil create the tail number. In PEX you wil need to add the new tail number in the Aircraft Module and then in the U2 module you wil need to map it to the UC2 tail number. EMOC operators can modify aircraft status and that information will flow through UL to PEX. ATO mission information will be imported into PEX from a 2000/2004 or NATO ATO file. PEX then creates missions and sorties which appear on PEX mission/sortie displays. After scheduling manipulation in PEX, the UC2 operator will poll PEX for available ATOs and select the ATO of interest. They import the ATO and then the systems subscribe to changes. Al missions and sorties associated with the ATO of interest will flow to UC2, but only a subset of the data associated with those missions and sorties is exchanged. After that, any \u201cChange ATO\u201d or manual change to an ATO mission/sortie will automatically flow to UC2. At a certain point, UC2 passes ATO mission data to TBMCS-FL. There is no indication in PEX as to whether UC2 has subscribed to any particular ATO. See the ATO help topic for how to import an ATO. Labels \u00b6 Many of the tab names and column headers in PEX can be re-named. This re-labeling is useful for re-purposing otherwise unused columns, for example. Re-labeling is accomplished differently depending on whether you are working on an older PEX module or a newer one. The newer ones have a Page Settings button near the top-right of the screen. Re-label in newer modules. Click the Page Settings button and select Edit Labels. Re-label in older modules. Go to Setup > Labels (WinPEX only). The Labels tab lists the older screens within PEX that contain modifiable labels. Selecting a PEX screen will display the labels within that screen. The displayed Default Label Text can be changed to user-defined labels by entering Override Label Text. Once the override text is entered it wil replace the default text in the applicable screen. Changes made here are applied throughout the database by squadron. If the affected module is open, the change will not take effect until it is re-opened. Locations \u00b6 Concept The Locations module allows you to enter locations for scheduling purposes and provides a quick reference for location information. Locations can be entered from any of four sources: manually-input PEX locations (the most common), PFPS, ATO, and ACO locations. PFPS, ATO, and ACO locations are added automatically during interfaces with those respective programs. Existing Locations The Locations tab lists all the locations contained in your database. The locations grid allows filtering, adding, deleting, and editing of each location. Using the Selection Criteria area, you can filter locations by Source, Type, Location name, or Description. Enter your selections and click Display Data. The Locations tab shows you all the locations in a spreadsheet view. If you pick a location and go to the Details tab, you\u2019ll see all the particulars about that location in a form view (easier for editing). before I use the module Go to the Setup tab to manage the lists of Countries, Country Codes, and Location Types used throughout the Locations module. (Radio Frequency Types and Theaters are not used anywhere in PEX.) Right-click and Add to add an entry. To delete an entry, right-click and Delete. To edit an entry, click on the field and enter the data. Click off the row to save. Add a location First, ensure that the location does not already exist in the database. Sometimes, a location is mistakenly entered twice, with a slight variation in the name or description, which causes problems when using two PEX locations that are essential y the same place. Place the cursor in the Locations grid, right-click and select Add. Enter the supporting data and save the location. Latitude and Longitude are not required fields; however, they are necessary if you plan to use the Distance-Time-Fuel feature of the Mission Board. Most entries are self-explanatory. Not self-explanatory are: Latitude and Longitude Longitude allows N or S, with any format with at least XX degrees. You can enter any degree, minute, or second combination out to the 6th decimal place. For example, you can enter: XX.XXXXXX degreesXX degrees, and XX.XXXXXX minutes XX degrees, XX minutes, and XX.XXXXXX seconds XX degrees, XX minutes, and XX seconds Latitude allows E or W, with any format with at least XXX degrees in the same formats as listed for longitudes. Set Zulu Offset In the Zulu Offset drop-down, select how many hours the location is normally offset from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Then, select a Daylight Saving Time (DST) rule from the DST Rule Dropdown. Show in Dropdowns Check this box to display the location throughout the rest of PEX. When the location is no longer used, un-check the box. Frequencies This is not used for anything in PEX. We recommend not entering data here. It allows you to enter several radio frequencies associated with the location. To add a new frequency, place the cursor in the Frequency grid, right-click and select Add. A new frequency line will be generated. Enter the control ing agency and the frequency. To delete a frequency, highlight it, right-click and select Delete. A warning will appear, click Yes, and the frequency wil be deleted. Frequencies entered here do not show up anywhere else in PEX. Delete a location Many times, you cannot. Once a location has been used (scheduled), it cannot be deleted. To delete an unused location, highlight the location, right-click and select Delete. A warning appears. Click the Yes button and the location is deleted. Personnel \u00b6 Personnel Basics Introduction The Personnel module is where you enter and manage the personnel data of individuals in the PEX database. Personnel must be entered here before they can be used in the Scheduling, Training, or Stan/Eval modules. People, and their data, may be added manually, via an ARMS import, or by importing their personnel file from another PEX database. Existing data may be updated manually or via the ARMS import. Permissions PEXAdmin user has full permission to all squadrons in a database. Users with Administrator or Training Auditor/ARMS permission can Add, Edit or Delete items in this module. A Basic User can view their personal information without having access to others' information. They can add, edit and delete their contact information. Rules Personnel are identified by their ID#, normally the social security number. The ID# is unique to the database, meaning two personnel records cannot have the same ID#. !!! Caution Each person should have a single personnel record in the database. If a person has duties in multiple squadrons, they can be assigned permissions in those squadrons. If a person does have two personnel records, one record would require a \"dummy\" ID#. These records cannot be merged. An exception to this might be a person having two jobs in the same unit. For example, a person may be a contractor, while also holding a traditional ANG position. Module Notes Information contained in the Personnel module is referred to as a personnel record . A user account establishes a person's PEX login and permission roles. Most people have both a personnel record and a user account. Some people only have a personnel record, allowing them to be tracked and scheduled for events, e.g., guest help. Others only have a user account, allowing them to log in and view information, e.g., base operations. For more on user accounts see Setup > Users & Permissions. The dropdown menus in Personnel are editable in the Personnel > Setup tab. Navigate to the Setup tab and look for the desired field, or, in the dropdown, simply click on Edit Values. For more see - Configure Personnel for your unit. Controls Access these procedures by navigating to Setup > Personnel. Workspace Personnel tab. Contains information on all people in the selected Fly Squadron. This information is broken down in specialized tabs 2 through 6. information in blue-shaded fields cannot be edited ion this tab. Details tab. Contains general information on a selected individual person, including Special Experience Identifier (SEI) and Supervisor information. Duties tab. Contains information on a selected individual's primary and additional duties, including DNIF status. Contact tab. Contains information on a selected individual's street addresses, phone numbers and email address. Quals tab. Contains information on a selected individual's primary and additional MDS/Crew Position qualifications. Status tab. Contains information on a selected individual's status, such as DNIF, Title 10 or Title 32 status. Supervision tab. Designates those people supervised by the selected individual. Roster tab. Design and create a customized unit personnel roster. Setup tab. Select and customize which information populate dropdowns for your unit. Page Settings. Contains Label Manager and Legend. The former allows overwriting existing column header (label) names. Filter wizard. Opens the standard PEX filter wizard. Page refresh. Personnel Details by tab This topic describes in detail functionality in individual Personnel module tabs. If a specific function is \"greyed-out\" or un-editable on a particular page, go to the source page to make edits. Personnel This tab consolidates all personnel data for all persons in the database. In the Fly Sq dropdown, you can access any single squadron, or all squadrons, to which you have permission. Most columns are self-explanatory, some warrant further explanation. The process for importing, exporting and manually creating personnel records is described in Add, Move, Import and Export Personnel. The \u03a6 symbol indicates fields that are overwritten with each ARMS import. Meaning, if you change the data in a field, importing an ARMS csv will set that field to whatever is in ARMS. This feature can be overridden in Continuation Training. ID# is normal y a person's social security number but can be any nine-digit number. Each person's ID# is unique to the database, meaning no two personnel records can have the same ID#. Fly Sq is the squadron to which the person is assigned. If in ARMS, a person's Fly Sq should match that in ARMS. These squadrons come from the Setup > Squadrons module. Non-Fly Sq is for squadrons to which a person is attached for other duties. This dropdown list is populated from the Personnel > Setup page. Eval Form Org overwrites signature blocks on evaluation forms. See Stan Eval for more. DNIF sets a person as DNIF on the Go/NoGo board. Changing DNIF status here functions the same as that in Go/NoGo. Service Status sets a person to follow rules for people who are A-Active Duty, R-Air Force Reserve, or G-Air National Guard. Call Sign is a free text entry to associate a call sign to an individual. It cannot be assigned to a sortie. UD 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are User Defined. These columns can be used for any data with no existing field. UD 1, 2, 6 and 7 are dropdowns, configurable in the Setup tab. UD 3, 4, and 6 are free-text. Pri Exp Risk feeds the ORM module. Avail Enabled enables/disables availability for a specific person, for units with both active duty and reserve personnel. Teams enable individuals to be assigned to unit-defined teams. Unlike squadron, flight or office symbol, an individual an be assigned to multiple teams. Export AFTO 781 Data. Checking No blocks the export of 781 data for guest flyers, or people who fly with your unit but are not assigned to your unit. Exporting personnel data to the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) is accomplished by right-clicking on a row, selecting Export to DRRS, and saving the file to your local computer. Details This tab incorporates some of the functionality described in the Personnel module, plus is the primary tab for adding SEI and supervisor data. To add SEI identifiers, right-click in the SEI grid and select the appropriate identifier from the dropdown list. To select supervisors, right-click in the Supervisor grid, select the Fly Sq and Supervisor. This can also be accomplished in the Supervision tab. Duties This tab incorporates some of the functionality described in the Personnel module, plus adds Additional Duties. Right-click in the Additional Duties grid and select the desired duty. Contact This tab allows you to add multiple street addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. For each, right-click in the Addresses, Phone Numbers or Email Addresses grid. First select a Type, then fill in the appropriate information. !!! note Within each grid, each entry must have a unique type, such as Home or Work. I.e., a person cannot have more than one \"Home\" phone number. You can however, create additional types of, e.g., Home 1, Home 2, etc. in Setup. Quals This tab is were you can add and delete MDS/Crew Positions and related data. To be able to effective utilize personnel data in the various PEX modules, it is essential for all personnel records to have at least one MDS and Crew Position selected. One MDS/CP must be selected as Primary. Others can be added as required. If in ARMS, a person's qualification code and crew position is included in the ARMS import. MDS must be selected manually. If not in ARMS, or if the person holds multiple MDSs or crew positions, add an MDS/CP be selecting right-click, select Add, and fill in the required data. Status The Status tab is intended to identify people on Title 10 or Title 32 status, with inclusive dates, but can be used to identify people on any unit-status such as DNIF or Deployed. Right-click and select Add. When the dialog opens select the Status type, Effective Date and Expiration Date, and add any remarks. Supervision The Supervision tab allows you to designate supervisors. This is similar to the function in the Details tab. Here however, first select the Supervisor's Short Name in the dropdown. In the filterable Available Personnel grid, check the names of all people the person supervises, then click Assign. Those names will move to the Assigned Personnel grid. As a supervisor, you can view information on your supervisee's in My Page > Folders > My Supervisee's. This can also designate in-turn supervision. For example, Capt Mart\u00ecnez supervises MSgt Smith, who in turn supervises SrA Goldstein. First set Mart\u00ecnez as Smith's supervisor, then set Smith as Goldstein's supervisor. Roster The Roster tab is used to create, print and export-to-Excel rosters. In the columns grid, select the fields desired. Drag-and-drop the selected fields to the order desired. In the Sections grid, select Sections and Types. This can be used to select specific types, e.g., work and cel phone numbers while ignoring home and fax numbers. Setup This topic describes functionality in the Personnel > Setup tab. For more on how to setup the overall personnel module see the topic _____ . The Setup tab contains those data which populate the Personnel dropdowns. The Tables list equates to labels, or column headers. Selecting a table name displays the selections available for that label. NOTE: The selections are stored in the database Master List, so there is a single instance of each. When adding a selection to your squadron, you wil select it from the Master List. If it does not exist in your database, you will first create it in the Master List, then assign it to your squadron. To add a selection of, for example, 1A150 to DAFSC: Select DAFSC in the Tables grid. In the Listings grid, view a list of DAFSCs already assigned to your squadron. Right-click and select Add. The Master List opens, showing all DAFSCs in the database. If the desired DAFSC appears, check it and click OK (or Apply). If the desired DAFSC does not appear, Right-click in the Master List dialog and select Add. In the open Duty AF Specialty Code field, type in the required DAFSC, (in this case 1A150), check it and click OK. 1A150 appears in the DAFSC Table list, and will now appear in the DAFSC dropdowns. Setup - Configure Personnel for your unit Configure the display In the Personnel tab, right-click anywhere in the display area and select Grid Settings. Set number of people to display on a one-page view in Records per page field (set 999 to see all), then select Font size. Check the columns to display, then Save. The columns may be moved by left-mouse click/hold and drag on the column header. When the display is set, right-click and click Save Layout. The other tabs work the same way. Page Settings Click the Page Settings icon at upper-right and select Labels. Label Manager allows Grid Column Default Labels to be overridden with a custom label. For example, if there is a column you do not use, you could re-label it and use it to track something else. Close the module to save changes. Click \u201cLegend\u201d; the \u03a6 symbol indicates fields that are overwritten with each ARMS import. This is important to consider for data entry; a manual entry in an ARMS field will be retained until the next ARMS import (usually daily) overwrites it. Manage the Personnel list Click the funnel icon next to Page Settings to open the filter tool. The list can be narrowed-down by Crew Position, Flight, etc. An applied filter must be de-selected (click Clear Filter) to restore the full squadron list. Customize Dropdown Lists In the Personnel > Setup tab, select the selections you need in your squadron's dropdown lists. This is described in Personnel > Personnel Details by tab > Setup. If you are setting up more than one squadron, you can create the list in one squadron, then send to others. For each Table, right-click in the Listings grid and select View/Edit Master List. When it opens you can see which entries already exist in your database and which need to be added. Edit lists as desired. For each list, right-click in the Listings grid and select Send To. When the dialog opens, select the squadrons to receive your list. Click Send To. Go to those squadrons and confirm your lists transferred correctly. Populate with your squadron's personnel See Add, Move, Import and Export Personnel for options. Assign an MDS to each person. !!! note If this is a new squadron and your are adding an MDS for the first time, when you click off the row to save the first-added MDS, PEX will ask if you to assign that MDS to the remaining people in the squadron. This is the only point at which you have the option to mass-assign the MDS in that squadron. Assign crew position(s) as required. Add, Move, Import and Export Personnel Transfer Personnel data Personnel data can be added to PEX by: (I) Adding a person manually. (II) Importing people or a person with an ARMS file. (III) Importing individual personnel files from another PEX database. (IV) Exporting personnel information as a personnel file, and the file sent to another unit for import into their PEX database. (V) Moving personnel information from one squadron to another squadron within the same PEX database. Personnel information import, export and move general information The following rules govern personnel exports, imports and moves. Personnel data. Most personnel data moves: Names, Date of Birth,Gender, Rank, Civilian Grade, AFSC, Duty AFSC, Passport Number, Separation Date and Special Experience Identifiers. MDS/CP Qualifications. All Quals in Personnel are exported. If the gaining squadron has matching MDS and CP, Quals are imported. Certifications (Letter of X.) All certifications are exported as they are setup in the losing squadron\u2019s LoX. If the gaining squadron has matching Cert Name, MDS, CrewPosition and Status, then the certs import and are applied to the person. Non-matching LoXs are stored in database and are included in any future exports. Continuation Training Events. Al Unit Level tasks are exported, but they must be approved and audited (if auditing required). If the gaining squadron has matching Training Events (Task Code, Task Name, Program Codes) person is assigned the event. Non-matching events are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. These non-matching tasks can be viewed in the CT module. ARMS tasks are not exported as they can be imported into the gaining database through the normal ARMS import process. Qualification Training Courses. All data is exported (Historic Courses and Training Programs, Memos For Record, Person Training Documents, Scanned MFRs) but Courses must first be marked complete. Courses that are marked complete and their associated MFRs become historic after import. Qualification Training Task Lists. Open Task Lists move with all signatures and dates from the previous database. Form 623a Entries, CFETP Task Lists, Historic Training Programs, Memos For Record, Person Training Documents, Scanned MFRs move. Stan Eval. All data is exported (Certification Scans, Qualification Certificate Scans, Qualification Certificate Images, Record of Evaluation Scans, Memo for Record Images, Memo For Record Scans, Certifications, Person Crew Quals, Major Discrepancy Scans, Major Discrepancy Images, Minor Discrepancy Scans, Minor Discrepancies), but all MFRs and Major Discrepancies must be signed. Export is allowed with an open evaluation but the open evaluation itself is not exported. FCIF. Al FCIFs/IRFs are exported, but are subject to \u201cexact match\u201d rules upon import. Type, Number, and Subject must match exactly. Non-matching FCIFs are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. SEI. Al SEIs are exported, but are subject to \u201cexact match\u201d rules upon import. Non-matching SEIs are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. Exams. Exam data does not move and PEX does not prevent an export if the person has open exams. Completed evaluation requisite exam data moves, as part of the evaluation. Permission Roles. Roles do not move. (I) Add a person manually In the Personnel tab: Right-click in the Personnel tab, select Add, and you are taken to the Details tab. Click on the Details tab. Ensure you have the person's assigned squadron selected in the Fly Sq dropdown. Required: In the Details grid, enter a Short Name for the person. Typically, this is Firstname.Lastname (Ellen.Ripley) or LastnameFirstnameinitial (RipleyE). Although not required, this Short Name often matches the person's User Name in Users and Permissions. We recommend using the same naming convention for all personnel. Required: Enter the person's ID #. Typically, this is the person's social security number but can be any nine-digit number. This number must be unique in the database. If the number is not unique PEX displays an alert informing you of which squadron contains a person with that ID number. Save. Click Save & New to add another person. Click Save to save the entered required information and continue adding to the person's information. Not required but: Entering the following information is not required to save the record but is needed to effectively track and manage the person's information in PEX. Enter the person's First, Middle and Last Names. Click on the Quals tab and assign an MDS, Qualification Code, and Crew Position. Click on the Contacts tab and add an email address Other information such as Rank, etc. can be added as required. If the person needs a User Account (to enable login to PEX), you can now go to Users and Permissions and create the account. (I ) Import people or a person with an ARMS file This is covered in detail in ARMS- Configure your PEX-ARMS Interface. Configure the ARMS - PEX interface in Continuation Training > ARMS. This involves adding your unit's 17-character unit identifier so PEX can match that identifier to the PEX squadron. Extract your unit's personnel data from ARMS and save as a .csv file. Save the file to an accessible location on your computer or network. Import the file in Continuation Training > ARMS. Check the log file for any errors. Go to Setup > Personnel > Personnel tab and confirm any new people were successful y added. For the newly added personnel, go to Setup > Personnel > Quals tab and assign an MDS. (I I) Import individual personnel files from another PEX database This assumes you have received the person's data file from the losing unit and saved it to an accessible location on your computer or network. The naming convention is LastnameFirstinitial.pexdata. In the Personnel tab, right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select Import/Export > Import Personnel Data. When the Import Personnel Data dialog opens, browse to the .pexdata file. Click Begin Import. If the personnel record does not already exist, it wil be created. If the personnel record already exists, you will be given a warning that the all existing data will be overwritten and the opportunity to cancel the operation. The import brings in Unit Tasks, if there are matching Unit Tasks; FCIFs, if there are matching FCIFs; and SEIs, if there are matching SEIs. View the import log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Import Person Logs. Successful imports have a green check, unsuccessful imports have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. (IV) Export personnel data as a personnel file In the Personnel tab, right-click on the person and select Import/Export > Export Personnel Data When the Export Personnel Data dialog opens, click Begin Export. If there are any outstanding issues that need to be resolved, PEX will inform you (open training, open evaluations, open PEX courses, or unsigned MFRs). View the export log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Export Logs Personnel Data. Successful exports have a green check, unsuccessful exports have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. Save the resulting file (LastnameFirstinitial.pexdata) and send it to the gaining unit. After exporting a person\u2019s data you should move them to your inactive (PCS) squadron. See the Change Squadron topic below. We recommend you add a step in your out-processing checklists to accomplish this export. (V) Move personnel data from one squadron to another squadron (Change Squadron) People may be moved to another squadron in the same PEX database as long as they have no open training tasks (approve/export them), no open qualification courses (close out or un-enroll) or unsigned MFRs. In the Personnel tab, right-click on the person you want to move and select Change Squadron. In the dialog, note the correct person\u2019s name is selected. You can check/add more people at this point. Select the destination squadron from the list Click Change Squadron for Personnel, and Yes at the confirmation dialog. A progress indicator will launch. View the change log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Change Squadron Logs. Successful moves have a green check, unsuccessful moves have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. Personnel TTPs MDS and Crew Position MDSs are setup in the Maintenance > Aircraft module. For your MDS to appear in the Personnel module, it must be identified in Setup > Squadrons > Display MDS in Dropdowns column. Crew Positions are setup in Setup > Personnel > Setup > Crew Position. The selected squadron\u2019s list displays. Right-click to Add or Delete. Qual Codes are managed the same way through the Aircrew Qualification Code page. Assign a Crew Position to a person. For ARMS units, this is done through the ARMS import. Qual Codes are assigned the same way. For non-ARMS units, on the Quals tab, select from the dropdown list in Crew Pos and Qual Code fields, click off the line to Save. Assign an MDS by going to the Quals tab and selecting the person. Click in the MDS field and select the MDS. Click off the line to Save. People may be assigned multiple MDSs but only one can be marked as Primary. The bare minimum. Assign a single MDS/CP to a person. If the person accomplishes duties in other MDS/CP combinations, those should also be added. For example, the person may be qualified in different CPs in the same MDS. Each of 403 those should get a separate line item. The person may be qualified in the same CP in multiple MDSs. Each of those should get a separate line item. For each MDS/CP line item, identify characteristics such as: Qual Code, Experience, Weather Category, etc. These characteristics go along with the person\u2019s MDS/CP qualification, not just the person. How users can view and update their own information Anyone with a user account can view their personnel data and update their contact information. On My Page click the My Personal Data link. Users can view their data in the Details, Duties, Contact, Qual and Status tabs. They can add, edit and delete Addresses, Phone Numbers, and Email Addresses on the Contact tab. We suggest that personnel login to PEX at regular intervals and keep this information updated, especially the home email addresses, as this is where PEX sends notifications of scheduling changes, assigned exams, assigned evaluations, and late requisites. Remove a person leaving your unit When moving people to another database (e.g., PCS), as opposed to moving people from one squadron to another within the same database (e.g., PCA), that person's data file is exported and sent to the gaining unit. We recommend that the losing unit, instead of attempting to delete the person, move them to an inactive squadron in their unit's database. That squadron is created locally and is often called \"PCS\" or similar. This way their personnel record is still retrievable if necessary. Simply follow the instructions for Move a person from one squadron to another (Change Squadron), selecting the inactive squadron. Guest Flyers For \u201cGuest Flyers\u201d, add them as normal, then check the block for Do Not Export 781 Data and enter their home base HARM 781 Flying Orgn. When exporting 781s, their data will not export, even though they are on the 781. Build Unit Task Codes (UTC) in PEX UTCs may be built in PEX and exported to Excel for further manipulation and data entry. Go to Setup > Personnel > Setup, click Unit Task Code from the list 4. First, configure the grid: right-click, select Grid Settings, de-select all un-needed columns. Then, left-click, hold/drag columns to desired placement. Right-click, Save Layout.

Right-click, select Export to Excel. Delete the Unassigned values in the Squadron column. This Excel sheet can now be filled with the names and squadrons of the actual people assigned to the deployment. More than one UTC. Add them all to PEX. Export the entire list to Excel and delete (in Excel) the undesired UTC records. Handle Inbound Deployed Personnel in your PEX Database Let\u2019s say you have a PEX database already in use at your base. Now some deployed personnel join your unit temporarily, such as an exercise or to sit alert. You can add them to PEX so that they can be scheduled and tracked for No-Go. Contact the person\u2019s home unit and obtain: A list of the person\u2019s Letter of X certifications. An extract, for just that person, of the unit\u2019s Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files from the PEX browsers. Append .CSV files. Open the Personnel .CSV extract file for the deployed person. Copy the data line(s) from the extract (not the header line). Open your unit's Personnel .CSV file and scroll to the bottom of the file. Paste the extract data beneath the last data line of the .CSV file and save. Repeat the steps for both the Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files. Import the .CSV extracts. Go to training > Continuation > ARMS > Settings and ensure your squadron is selected. In the Squadrons & ARMS Unit Identifiers field set, in the \u201cAdd ARMS unit to import into selected PEX squadron:\u201d text box, type in the 9-character ARMS unit code from the person\u2019s Personnel Flying Hours .CSV file and click Add. Then type in the 17-character ARMS unit code from the person\u2019s Training.CSV file and click Add. In the .CSV File field set, browse to your unit's appended Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files and click Save. Go to the Import view, and import Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours into your squadron. !!! Note In order to export this person\u2019s AFTO 781 flying hours and training tasks back into ARMS, you wil need permissions to the person\u2019s home station ARMS database. Usually, you will not have these permissions. Add Personnel Details. Go to Setup > Personnel > Details, select the new person, and add the following data: Arrival (date) and Departure (date). Assign the person a supervisor, if appropriate. Add Quals & Certs. Go to Setup > Personnel > Quals & Certs, and assign the person an MDS/Crew Position/WX Cat/Msn Ready Status (5.7+)/Experience (5.7+). Assign any Letter of X certifications that are applicable to your mission and organization.(Assigning an MDS/Crew Position will automatically assign this person all the FCIFs for that MDS/Crew Position. It also makes them available for flight scheduling.) Add Personnel Duties. Go to Setup > Personnel > Duties, and assign Pri Exp Ind (5.6-) and Msn Rdy Status (5.6-). Check the box \u201cDo Not Export 781 Data\u201d, enter the person\u2019s 781 Flying ORGN (can be bogus), and Save. Verify Applicable FCIFs are assigned. Go to Ops > FCIF and filter for that person\u2019s MDS/Crew Position to verify the person shows up in the list and is assigned all the appropriate FCIFs. Assign Required Unit Level Tasks. Go to Training > Continuation > Unit Task Assignment and assign the person any Unit Tasks required by your unit. Verify Personnel Flying Hours Status. Go to Scheduling > Reports > Personnel Flying Hours and run the report to make sure the new person shows up in the list. Note any potential problem with high flying time that might arise and develop a plan to manage it. Verify Training Tasks Status. Go to Training > Continuation > Training Tasks, ensure your squadron is selected, and click the \u201cClear Filter\u201d button in the top right of the screen if it is in view. Verify the person you just imported is listed. At the top left of the screen, change the date to the person\u2019s scheduled Departure Date from step 3 above. Note all the training events that will go overdue while the person is deployed to your location and develop a plan to keep the person current on the ones that matter to you. PEX User Login. If you want the person to be able to login to PEX for viewing the schedule, entering and acknowledging commitments, taking exams, etc.: Ensure the person has a Windows account to log on to the computers. Add a PEX User Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Users and add the person as a PEX User. Associate the PEX Users Account to the Windows Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Windows Accounts and associate the PEX User you just added to the person\u2019s Windows account. (Assigning the person a PEX user account wil allow them to sign off PEX FCIFs.) Associate Permissions to the PEX User Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Permissions and make sure the person has the permissions required for duty (at least Basic User to the squadron). Assign Exams. Go to Stan Eval > Testing Admin > Exam > Assigned Exams and assign the person all the appropriate tests. This checklist is based on the assumption that no formal upgrades or evaluations are conducted on the inbound deployed person. If that is not the case, the person would need to be assigned to a PEX Qualification Training course and/or assigned a PEX Stan Eval evaluation. Aircraft. If the personnel bring their own airplanes, go to Maintenance > Aircraft > Aircraft and add the MDS, if not already listed. Fill in the ARMS MDS field. Select the squadron the airplane belongs to, add the tail number(s) (fil in the ARMS ID) and select any squadrons that may share the tail number. Redeployment. When the person leaves, go to Setup > Personnel and change the person\u2019s Fly Sq to the \u201cPCS\u201d squadron or equivalent. If you don\u2019t have a PCS squadron in PEX, go to Setup > Squadrons and add it. When the aircraft leaves, go to Maintenance > Aircraft > Aircraft > Tail Number, uncheck any Shared Squadrons, uncheck the box for \u201cShow in Dropdown\u201d and change the Squadron to PCS. Reports \u00b6 Reports Overview Introduction Currently, most functional areas (Scheduling, Training, etc.) include a Reports module, containing all forms and reports for that function. Starting in 5.16, these will be progressively replaced by Rapid Reports/Reporting functionality. The legacy Reports modules will remain in place until the transition is complete. Currently, these reports pull data only from legacy modules. Rapid Reports are official USAF forms, standardized reports, and unit-customized reports. Units can request unit-customized reports from the PEX Program Office. All reports are in Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file format and can be downloaded from the PEX website or sent from the PEX help desk. Once imported, USAF forms can be opened in PDF format, while reports can be opened in PDF or Excel formats. The Setup > Reports module functions as the reports manager. Downloaded reports are imported into PEX through this module. Once imported, reports appear in the appropriate modules. Reports can be deleted when no longer required. Reports currently in development include: AF Form 4327 AF Form 4327a AFTO Form 781 Bomber Scheduling Report Fighter Scheduling Report Recon Scheduling Report RPA Schedule Missile Operations Personnel Schedule Missile Operations Location Schedule Workspace Add Report(s) imports report files. Displays a list of imported files. Refreshes the page. Removes unnecessary files. Manage and Use Reports Import a Report Request the desired file from the PEX website or have it sent from the PEX help desk. Save the report file to an accessible location. Go to Setup > Reports. When the MANAGE REPORTS page opens, click Add Report(s). When the browser opens, browse to the saved file and click Upload. You should see a (file name) uploaded successfully message. Click Cancel or X. The imported file is listed here and will appear in the appropriate functional area Reporting module. Delete a Report Go to Setup > Reports. When the MANAGE REPORTS page opens, click the More Options (...) button. Click Remove. Confirmation: Yes or No. View Uploaded Forms and Reports Go to the desired functional area Reporting module (e.g., Scheduling > Reports). View the list of Installed Reports. For example, to view an AF4327A, go to Scheduling > Reporting > Installed Scheduler Reports > AF4327A. Open and Populate Forms and Reports Go to the desired functional area Reporting module. Under Installed Reports, click the desired report. When the report dialog opens, make your data field selections for that form or report. At page bottom select PDF or Excel and click Generate Report. !!! note AF Forms open only in PDF format. Reports open in both PDF and Excel formats. Resources \u00b6 Resources Basics Introduction Configuring the Resources module allows you tailor and streamline your scheduling processes by categorizing and grouping resources. Resources are people, places and things that can be scheduled in the Scheduler. Resource Types are categories of resources, such as people, airspace and aircraft. Resource Groups are collections of resources. The actual resources are added to PEX in their respective modules; People in Personnel, Airspace in Locations, Aircraft in Maintenance, etc. In the Resources module, you first associate resources to a resource type, then associate resources to one or more groups. For example, you can create a hard crew group with four persons, then schedule them as a group instead of individual y, similar to Crew Sets in legacy scheduling modules. Controls Access these procedures by navigating to Setup > Resources. Module Notes A resource group consists of a single type of resource. For example, a Group can contain Persons or Workstations, but not Persons and Workstations. Resources are used only in the Scheduler module. They do not apply to legacy scheduling modules. Workspace View Resource Types. View Resource Groups. Filter on Resource Types. Create Resource Groups by Type. Manage Your Resources Associate Resources to Types Some Resource Types are delivered with PEX. More Resource Types can be added locally by running a script file on your database server. Contact the PEX Program Office to have the script created. Go to Setup > Resources > Types. Click on the desired Type and view individual resources of that type. The list also displays any groups they are associated with. Use the search field to locate specific resources by name or number. Add a Group Under the Groups header, click the Add button and the Add Group dialog opens. In the Name field, enter a name for the group. Under Resource Type, click Change and select the type. Under the resource type Name, click the Add button. From the list, select the resources to add to the group. Click Done and the Add dialog closes. Click Save and the Add dialog closes. In Scheduler, the group can now be added to an event, as with an individual resource item. Add Resources to a Group Go to Setup > Resources > Groups. Click on the desired Group and view individual resources in that group. Use the search field to locate specific groups by name or number. Use the filter (funnel) as required. Under Resource Groups, click on the desired group and the edit dialog opens. Click the edit (pencil) button and the Edit Group dialog opens. Under the Resource Type heading, select the type of resource to be grouped, e.g., Person and click Add. From the list, check the resources to add to the group. Click Done and the dialog closes. Click Save and return to Groups. Delete Resources from a Group Go to Setup > Resources > Groups. Click on the desired Group and view individual resources in that group. Use the search field to locate specific groups by name or number. Use the filter (funnel) as required. Under Resource Groups, click on the desired group and the edit dialog opens. Click the edit (pencil) button and the Edit Group dialog opens. From the list, check the resources to delete from the group. Click Save and return to Groups. Delete a Group Quick method Go to Setup > Resources > Groups. To the right of the no longer desired group, click the red X and Yes to the confirmation message. Recommended method Go to Setup > Resources > Groups. Click on the desired group and the Group Details dialog opens. Verify this is the group you want to delete. Click the delete (trash can) button and Yes to the confirmation message. Squadrons \u00b6 Squadrons Basics Introduction The Squadrons module identifies units in the PEX database that wil be used throughout PEX, to define Availability Periods for these squadrons, and to register the squadrons with HQ for scheduling and training data rol ups. Access to data throughout PEX is control ed by squadron and user. Permissions The PEXAdmin and Administrator permission roles can access Squadrons. Rules While Administrator can add a squadron, only PEXAdmin can delete a squadron. A squadron can have only a single set of (up to) six Availability Periods active at one time. Module Notes A new squadron wil not display in other PEX modules until you log out and back in. When a squadron is added; initially, the only users with permissions to that squadron will be the user that added it and the master user account, PexAdmin. Workspace These features are accessed by navigating to Setup > Squadrons. Squadrons. Work area. Setup. Add lists of organizations. Labels Manager. Overwrite label (column header) names. Availability Periods. Define up to six periods for the squadron. Setup - Associate organizations to your squadron In Setup, you can add organizations, then link them when you add a squadron. Add a MAJCOM Under the Tables list, highlight MAJCOM. In the Listings grid, right click and select ADD. Enter the MAJCOM and its description. Click off the row to save. Add a Wing Under the Tables list, highlight Wing. In the Listing grid, right click and select ADD Enter the Wing, Description. Associate the new Wing to an existing MAJCOM and enter a Location name.

Click off the row to save. Add a Unit Type Under the Tables list, highlight Unit Type. In the Listings grid, right click and select ADD. Enter the unit type and its description. For example: Fighter, Bomber, MAF, CAF, Intel, etc. Click off the row to save. Add a Squadron A squadron in PEX is the foundational organization to which resources are assigned; people, aircraft, etc. Other functions such as displays and permission roles are also set by squadron. A PEX squadron can be a literal squadron or another organization type, such a group. Right Click in the Squadrons grid and select Add. Enter a unique Squadron name. Enter an Installation name, e.g., \u201cEglin AFB, FL\u201d. (Optional but recommended) Enter the ICAO identifier, e.g., \u201cKVPS\u201d. (Optional but recommended) Select a Group name from the drop down. (Optional but recommended) Select a Service. (Optional but recommended) Enter number of Aircraft the squadron possesses. (Optional) Enter number of Personnel for the squadron. (Optional) Enter SunRiseBASH and SunSetBASH times. This is the estimated duration in minutes that Bird Air Strike Hazard occurs. This data is calculated and then displayed in the scheduling areas of PEX. (Optional) Enter Flt Lead Symbol and Deputy Lead Symbol. This data will display on flight authorization forms. (Optional) Select MDSs in Display MDS in Dropdowns. These are the MDSs your squadron wil see throughout PEX. Enter POC Name, POC Email and POC Phone fields. This data is used for the MAJCOM Registration and the POC Information on the PEX Navigation Menu. (Optional) Unit type. Select from a list to further define the squadron. (Optional) Unit Identification Code (UIC). Enter your UIC. (Optional) Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) System. Enter your PAS. (Optional) Include Readiness Data in Export. Check this box if you are establishing a NIPR to SIPR connection and wish to export readiness data. Otherwise leave it unchecked. Squadrons Availability Periods Availability periods, up to six, are used to describe blocks of time where personnel can identify when they are available to be scheduled. These periods are identified by the schedulers. Then, part-time personnel (think ANG and AFRC) can identify when they are available using those periods. The periods can overlap. Example periods are: Period: 00:00 \u2013 23:59 Periods (AM, PM, and Night): 05:00-12:00, 11:00-18:00, 17:00-23:59 Enter your squadron\u2019s Availability Periods Highlight the Squadron in the Squadron\u2019s grid Place the cursor in the Availability Periods grid, right-click and select Add. An Add Availability Period dialog will appear. Set the number of periods and set the start/end time for each period. Periods can (and usually do) overlap. For example, if you end one period at 09:00 and start the next at 09:01, it creates a gap of one minute and PEX will think personnel are unavailable for that one minute. Using this example, you should end the first period at 09:00 and start the second at 09:00. Periods can run from 00:00 to 23:59 (they cannot cross midnight). Click OK when finished. There can be up to six periods identified for a squadron. !!! NOTE Once saved, the periods cannot be edited. Instead, new Availability Periods set must be created to replace the old. Personnel and schedulers can use only the latest set for data entry. Old sets are displayed for historical purposes. Squadrons \u2013 HQ Registration \u00b6 Use HQ Registration to send your Scheduling and Training data to your MAJCOM. Your MAJCOM wil advise when to use this and supply the data required. Select Register Squadron to open the dialog. All field entries in this dialog are required. In the Info Type dropdown, select the data to register: Scheduling or Training. !!! note If you want to do both, two registrations must be added. In the Squadron drop down, select the squadron to register. Enter the MAJCOM. Enter the MAJCOM URL (provided by MAJCOM). Point of Contact. Enter the MAJCOM POC's Name, Phone Number, and Email. You can overwrite the default POC if you chose to. With all fields complete, select Save. Once saved, a new row entry appears indicating Squadron selected, MAJCOM Approval Status - \"Waiting\". Once saved, the MAJCOM must approve the registration. When the Registration is approved, MAJCOM Approval Status changes to - \"Approved\". Your squadron is now successfully registered and ready to start sending CT and/or Scheduling data. Upon initial Approval, the \"Last Sync Date\" column will be blank until scheduled or manual Sync's are accomplished. TaskView - Import an Airspace Control Order (ACO) \u00b6 Introduction The TaskView Interface reads an Airspace Control Order (*.aco) file and imports ACO locations into the PEX database. The ACO data retrieved includes the airspace type, name, latitude/longitude, and valid times. Once imported, the data retrieved from the ACO creates a new location in the Locations module. Import an ACO The following steps assume the ACO file has been downloaded and saved to an accessible location on your computer. Typically, the ACO, along with the ATO (Air Tasking Order), are downloaded from a website or another application. Go to Setup > TaskView > TaskView Import tab > Import Section. In the ACO Input File selection box, browse to the ACO file, and click Display Data. PEX displays the ACO Start Date/Time (Z) and End Date/Time (Z), and all ACM Types and Locations in the selected file. Enter the path for where you want the Log File stored. Select the ACM Types and/or Locations you want to import into PEX and click the Send button. With these ACO locations now in your database, you can use them to build missions and sortie events. Once in the PEX database, ACO locations can be used just like PEX, PFPS, and ATO locations. Managing Imported Locations The imported locations can be viewed and, if necessary, edited in the Locations module by selecting Source: ACO, and clicking Display Data. ACO locations may import without latitude/longitude. If so, manually enter lat/long as required. Zulu offsets and Daylight Saving Time (DST) offsets are not entered for ACO locations. For accurate local times at the ACO locations, manually enter the Zulu and DST offsets. If you are scheduling in Zulu only, there should be no need to enter Zulu and DST offsets for the ACO locations. For more, see Setup > Locations. Users and Permissions \u00b6 Users and Permissions Basics Introduction Users and Permissions allows administrators to manage who can log in to PEX (Users), what those people can do in PEX (Permissions), and how they can log in (CAC or Windows). User accounts can one of two types. An individual account, allowing a person log in and view their information in PEX. A joint-use account, which can be used by multiple people. Because multiple people can use it, joint-use accounts cannot be associated to a Personnel record. Permissions Users with Administrator permission to any squadron can access this page. However, they can see only those squadrons to which they have permission. Rules Users cannot change their own permissions. That must be done by PEXAdmin. Multiple people can be associated to the PEXAdmin user account. Users can be assigned the role of Administrator in individual squadrons. People assigned the Administrator role should be trained and experienced PEX users. Every squadron should have at least two people assigned the Administrator role. Workspace Users. Add User accounts for people who need to log in to PEX. Associate them to Personnel records so they can see their information. Permissions. Grant users the level of access required to perform their duties in PEX. CAC Accounts. Allow users to log in with a Common Access Card (CAC). This is useful when users cannot log in via an AFNet account. Windows Accounts. Al ow users to log in with a Windows domain account. This is the most common method. Joint-use accounts. These are not associated to an individual. Individual accounts. These are associated to individual Personnel records. !!! note Although not normal y required, users can be associated to both CAC and Windows logins if desired. Workflow Manage User Accounts Create Permission templates Create Permission templates to apply to new users: Go to Users and Permissions > Permissions tab. Check the Basic User role for your squadron. Click Save as New Template and call it \u201cBasic User (squadron name)\u201d.4. Repeat as required for various combinations of roles and squadrons. Add a User account Go to Users and Permissions > Users tab. Right-click and select Add User. In the Add User dialog, select the desired Default Template. Enter your email extension, e.g., @us.af.mil. Select your email convention, e.g., First.Last Person Associated. For individual person accounts, associate the user account to a Personnel record. If the person will accomplish activities in PEX (scheduled for commitments, training folder, Stan Eval folder, etc.), ensure they have a Personnel record in the Personnel module. Skip this step if the person will not accomplish activities in PEX but only login to PEX to see information (Air Traffic Control, Base Operations, Inflight Kitchen, etc.) For Joint Use Accounts, skip to User Details. Select the squadron to which the person is assigned. Select their Short Name from the dropdown. This list includes all persons who have a Personnel record but do not have a user account. User Details. PEX populates these fields. Make any desired changes to: User Name Email Full Name Loc. Use a Source of PEX and your Location, e.g., \u201cKVPS\u201d For Joint Use Accounts, check Joint Use Acct. If this account is associated to a person, the check box is disabled. Click Save. PEX will send an email to the new user informing them of the account and how to login. Adjust the person's permission roles if required. See Manage Permission Roles. Associate the new user to their CAC or Windows account. See CAC and Windows Associations. Find users not logging in Go to Users tab, right-click and select Filter By Last Login. In the dialog, select a time span and click OK. The resulting list is those users that have not logged in for that amount of time. To return to the complete user list, right-click, and select Edit Applied Last Login Filter, select No Filter, and click OK. Delete an account Go to Users tab, highlight the name, right-click and select Delete. Deleting a User account does not delete any data about the Person. All scheduling, training, Stan Eval, etc. data is retained. Multiple accounts can be deleted simultaneously by using the Ctrl or Shift keys to select multiple users. Lock out a user from PEX This prevents users from logging in. Go to Users tab. On the User name, right-click and select Lock User. To unlock, right-click and select Unlock User. Manage Permission Roles Squadron Administrators apply Permission Roles for individual PEX Users based on the duties performed in the unit. Grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the duties. Grant the top-level Administrator role only if required to access the Users and Permissions module. The Administrator role has permissions to all modules in PEX, not just the administrative ones. Each squadron should have at least two Administrators. View all Users in a Role On the Permissions tab, highlight the Role Name, e.g., Administrator. Right-click and select See Users In Role. The Users in (selected) Role dialog opens showing all users in that role. Change a user\u2019s permissions Every User Account starts with a set of permissions. If you need to edit these permissions: Go to the Permissions tab and highlight the User The user's assigned permissions appear under the squadron column(s). Check and un-check roles and squadrons as required. Click Apply Permissions. Save a User\u2019s permissions as a template for others Go to the Permissions tab and highlight the user who has the permissions from whom you want to create a template. That User's permissions will show up in the Users Permissions Grid. Click Save as New Template. Give the template a name (e.g., Basic User, Stan Eval) and select Save. The Template will now be available to apply when adding a new user, or editing existing users. Create a Template from Scratch Go to the Permissions tab and ensure no user is selected on the left and no boxes are checked. You may need to leave the module and come back. Select the desired Roles for the desired squadrons in the Users Permissions Grid by checking the appropriate boxes. Select Save as New Template, give the template a name, and select Save. The Template will now be available to apply when adding a new user, or editing existing users. Apply a Template to existing User Go to the Permissions tab. In the Users grid, select the user to whom you want to apply the template. Click Select Template. When the dialog opens, select the template you want and click OK. The new permissions will be displayed in the Users Permissions Grid, with the name of the template in the grid header. Select Apply Template. A warning will come up saying the current permission roles will be overwritten. Click OK to apply the template. CAC and Windows Associations Use the CAC or the Windows Accounts tab to associate user accounts to their CAC or Windows account so they can login to PEX. Associate a user to their CAC Go to the CAC Accounts tab In the CAC Accounts Available grid, right-click and select Add CAC Account to PEX In the dialog, enter the person\u2019s CAC Number and name from the CAC (not PEX User Name) Click OK and select the CAC you just entered In the Users grid, find the User Name and select it (right-click Filter Grid will prove useful) With a User and CAC selected, click the Associate CAC Account(s) button. The user will now be able to login to PEX via their CAC. Associate a user to their Windows account If your unit does not use CACs, associate your Users to their Windows accounts. If you associated the user to a CAC you should skip these steps. Go to the Windows Accounts tab In the Windows Accounts Available grid, right-click and select Add CAC Account to PEX Click the Find By Email button Enter the person\u2019s email address and click the Find button. This should auto-fill the Windows Account and Domain Names. Click OK and select the CAC you just entered. In the Users grid, find the User Name and select it (right-click Filter Grid will prove useful) With a User and Windows account selected, click the Associate Windows Account(s) button. The user will now be able to login to PEX via their Windows account. Joint Use Accounts A single Joint Use (PEX User) account can be associated to multiple CAC or Windows accounts. This way, multiple people could login to the \u201cBase Ops\u201d PEX user account, for example. Permission Matrix Validation \u00b6 The Validation module is used to standardize drop-down lists in three scheduling modules: Mission Board, Commitments Board, and Personnel Availability. Configure Validation The screen opens with two areas: \"Tables\", and \"Listings\", and a Squadron selector: Tables is subdivided into Mission Board, Commitments Board, and Personnel Availability. The entries within each sub-area correspond to drop-down lists in those modules. Listings displays the entries that appear in the drop-down lists. The Listings are modifiable by squadron and can be sent from one squadron to another. Add, edit and delete Table entries To edit the list of entries, select a squadron, expand the appropriate sub-area in the Tables list, and select the desired drop-down list (table). To add a new entry, right-click within the Listing grid and select Add. A Master Grid list of entries already in the database but not used by your squadron wil appear. If one of these is the desired entry, check the box to the left of the entry and click OK. If the desired entry is not in the list, right-click in the grid and select Add. To delete an entry, right-click on it and select Delete. This simply removes it from your squadron list but is retained on the Master List. To edit an entry, click directly on the field and edit. When you first add a squadron to PEX When a squadron is added to PEX, it copies the Unassigned squadron\u2019s validation entries into the new squadron. This reduces the time required to build a squadron\u2019s set of validation data. If you have a multi-squadron base and want quicker setup, edit all the validation tables for the Unassigned squadron first before adding your real squadrons. Share Listings across squadrons Right-click and select Send To. Select the check-box for the squadron(s) you wish to send the item(s) to and select Send Selected Items. Note: you must have permission (Ops Desk, Flight Scheduling, Ground Scheduling, or Flying Hours) to the other squadron(s) in order to Send To. How the Sortie Type table differs In addition to just the simple list of the sortie types used by your unit, use this table to identify: Whether this sortie type is a \u201cRAP\u201d sortie, for counting scheduled RAP sorties The Average Sortie Duration (ASD), for the Flying Hours module The default Standard Configuration Load (SCL), for auto-scheduling the SCL The Risk Value (1 = Low to 10 = High), for the ORM module How the Personnel Commitment Types table differs Personnel Commitment Types can be set to conflict (or not) with shifts. Normal y, when two commitments conflict, you would like PEX to warn you that someone is about to be double-scheduled. However, Shifts work a little differently. Many times, personnel are scheduled onto shifts in order for them to be scheduled for other activities during that shift. In those cases, the other commitments do not conflict with the shift, they are, instead, an integral part of the shift and you don\u2019t want PEX bringing up nuisance warnings. Use this table to mark those Personnel Commitment Types that do indeed conflict with a Shift, such as another Shift, or a Sortie, or TDY. Getting Started for PEX Administrators \u00b6 If you are setting up PEX for the first time, you will find the following general instructions useful. If PEX is already setup and you are a new PEX administrator, the following will give you a good idea of what has already been done. Detailed instructions on all the steps below can be found in the PEX built-in help and/or user manual. The PEX Database Manager has its own built-in help and user manual. The first step to using PEX is to install the PEX Database Manager and PEX Service Host applications on the SQL server that wil host your data. Use the Database Manager to instal a real-world Release database that will host your data. The PEX database is the center of all PEX operations. It contains all the data. For details on installing the PEX Database Manager and PEX Service Host, see the PEX Installation Guide. After the database is installed, use the Database Manager to associate CACs/Windows Accounts to PexAdmin and to normal PEX users. After the database is installed on a network server or a stand-alone desktop/laptop computer, install the: WinPEX software on all the machines that need access to the PEX Mission Board (flight scheduling). All other modules can be accessed via ePEX. ePEX on a web-server and add a hyperlink on your unit home page to ePEX. Launch the Locations module. Add your location, e.g., KVPS. With the location selected, enter the appropriate offset from GMT and a corresponding DST Rule. Launch the Users and Permissions module. NOTE that an initial User \u201cPexAdmin\u201d has been added. Highlight the PexAdmin line and select a Default Location Source of \u201cPEX.\u201d Then select the location entered in step 4 above as the Default Location. Launch the Squadrons module and add the units/squadrons that wil be using PEX plus a \"PCS\" squadron to which you wil eventual y move people that have left your unit. Once the squadrons are entered, personnel data can be added through the ARMS Interface or manually through the Personnel module. If your unit does not use ARMS, in the Personnel module, Setup tab, pick a unit and customize your lists. Once you are done with one squadron, you can use the right-click \"Send To\" command to copy the lists over to other units. In the Personnel module, add your personnel manually. Launch the Aircraft module and enter your aircraft MDSs and tail numbers. In the Users & Permissions module, assign other PEX users and grant them levels of access to the various PEX applications. Your unit is now ready to begin using PEX.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"PEX/Setup.html#setup","text":"","title":"Setup"},{"location":"PEX/Setup.html#external-interfaces","text":"Scheduling Interface Introduction Overview The Setup > External Interfaces module serves as a consolidated location to establish, manage and monitor data-exchange connections between PEX and other scheduling applications, including: Unit Command and Control (UC2) Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center (EMOC) Theater Battle Management Core Systems-Force Level (TBMCS-FL) Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS) Central Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) UC2, EMOC and TBMCS-Force Level Some locations conduct squadron operations using PEX while conducting various wing operations using UC2, EMOC, and TBMCS-FL. Data is shared between systems allowing PEX users access to relevant information. If properly configured and operated, the end result is a reduced reporting burden on the squadrons and enhanced communication to higher headquarters. UC2/EMOC maintains aircraft and aircraft status data. Updated data are exchanged between PEX and UC2, while EMOC can update both PEX and UC2. PEX does not directly update EMOC, although PEX can update UC2 which then flows EMOC. NOTES: In PEX, connectivity is established between these four systems (PEX, UC2, EMOC and TBMCS-FL) in two tabs. Once established however, operations in PEX appear seamless to schedulers. Not all data flows to each program. Typically, an AOR/AOC will have a single TBMCS-FL database, while an individual location may have one UC2 database and multiple PEX databases. GTIMS PEX imports scheduling data from GTIMS and displays the information in the Ops > Waterfall module. CSE CSE is a computerized system for the scheduling of all missions requiring the use of specific ranges or support resources. Scheduling data interfaces outside of the External Interfaces module Two interfaces are not active connections but simple file imports. Users normally download these files from a hosting website. Although the interfaces are not part of this module, the imported data is used throughout PEX scheduling functions. Air Tasking Order (ATO) files (*.ato) are imported into PEX in the Scheduling > ATO module, creating mission shells. These shells can then be edited with local data in the various PEX scheduling modules (Mission Board, Flying Schedule, etc.) Airspace Control Order (ACO) files (*.aco) are imported into PEX in the Setup > TaskView module, creating and/or updating location data in the Setup > Locations module.

Central Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) Overview Central Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) is a computerized system for the scheduling of all missions requiring the use of specific ranges or support resources. PEX Airspaces equate to CSE Ranges. Airspace locations are manually created in PEX > Locations. Range locations are imported from CSE. These two are then mapped together in Setup > Resources. PEX schedulers create missions in the PEX Mission Board, including airspace, and send a request for that airspace to CSE, via an automated interface. NOTES: Once a mission is sent to CSE and accepted, it cannot be re-sent. PEX 5.15 interfaces only with CSE-Nellis. Imported range locations are Read Only. A mission must have a valid Range Project Number to be accepted by CSE. Permissions Squadron Administrator or PEXAdmin. Establish and Verify CSE Connection Navigate to Setup > External Interfaces > CSE tab. Verify Mission Connection verifies PEX can send missions to CSE. Verify Ranges Connection verifies PEX can import ranges from CSE. Import Ranges to PEX Imports ranges, which appear in Setup > Resources. Connection Status.

Prior to establishing the connections, the Connection Status field is red, and the Status reflects \"...not activated...\" Click Verify Mission Connection. The Connection Status field should turn green, and the Status should reflect \"Connection successfully verified.\" Click Verify Ranges Connection. The Connection Status field should turn green, and the Status should reflect \"Connection successfully verified.\" Consult the CSE Test Logging log files as required. Click Import Ranges To PEX. A pop up informs you CSE Range Import Successful. Consult the CSE Range Import log file as required. The file reflects ranges successfully imported. If this range import is an update, as opposed to the initial import, it may also reflect ranges removed from the PEX database. Map PEX Airspace Locations to CSE Ranges Corresponding airspaces must be added in Setup > Locations before PEX and CSE locations can be mapped. Go to Setup > Resources > Types > Airspace List and view the list of Airspace locations from Setup > Locations. Select an Airspace, and the Airspace Details flyout on the right displays those CSE ranges, if any, currently mapped to the airspace. Each range is considered by PEX to be a \"group\" and will appear as such under the Airspace Details List. In the Airspace Details, click on the pencil icon to edit the ranges mapped to the airspace. This will open the Edit Airspace flyout. To map ranges to the airspace: In the Resource Groups section, select Add to add ranges to the airspace. In the Add Resource Groups flyout, the ranges not yet mapped to the airspace wil be listed. Select the checkboxes for those ranges to be mapped to the airspace. Select Done when all ranges have been selected. This wil return you to the Edit Airspace flyout. Select Save. !!! note Use the type ahead Search box at the top of the Add Resource Groups fly out to filter the list of ranges. To unmap ranges from the airspace: In the Resource Groups section, click on the red box with an X for the airspace to be unmapped. In the Confirmation dialog, select Yes or No as appropriate. Continue clicking on the red boxes until all airspaces to be unmapped have been removed. In the Edit Airspace flyout, select Save. To view all of the ranges mapped to each airspace at one time, in upper right corner of Resources page, select More Options (...). Select Show Groups. To hide the ranges, select More Options (...), then Hide Groups. !!! note Range mapping can be edited. The actual imported ranges cannot be edited. Workflow Schedule missions as normal in the Mission Board. Missions that will be sent to CSE must have at least one Airspace mapped to CSE ranges and a valid Range Project Number (Range Proj#). If these columns are not visible in the Sorties grid, unhide them using the View control. When ready to send range requests to CSE, go to Scheduling > Flying Schedule > Sorties tab. Click the CSE Export button, and the CSE Mission Export page is opened, with the Mission Filter flyout also open. Set filter by Squadron(s), Zulu/Local, Start Date/Time and End Date/Time. You can filter further by MDS and Airspace. Click Load. The CSE Mission Export page opens with all missions meeting your filter criteria. Two slider control options allow you to: Show Sent Missions. !!! note Once a mission is sent to, and accepted by CSE, it cannot be re-sent. Include Sortie Remarks. Sortie remarks (manually entered in the Mission Board > Sortie grid) are sent if this option is selected. NOTES: Mission remarks (manually entered in the Mission Board > Mission grid) are always sent. Range Report information is always sent, if those columns are checked in Mission Board. Available columns are GCI, GUN, JTIDS, LASER, LIVE, NACTS, RFMDS, THREATS and TOSS. Other exported data includes Squadron, Msn #, Cal Sign(s), IFF(s), Airspace and Entry/Exit (L) Times. Check all missions to be sent to CSE. When satisfied, click the Export to. . button, and Yes or No to the confirmation dialog. An Export Result Log dialog opens listing each exported mission. For each, a REJECTED or ACCEPTED BY CSE status is displayed. If rejected, a CSE error code and reason describe the error. Rejected and accepted totals are displayed at bottom. If you need to refer to this log file in the future, go to Setup > External Interfaces > Status tab, and call applicable the log file. In addition to Airspace and Range Project Number, PEX validated in CSE include: Squadron, MDS, Weapon Load Items and Codes, and Complete Round Codes (CRC). For any rejected missions, edit the data as required in the Mission Board or Flying Schedule and re-send. Scheduling Operations Local procedures and command guidance determine when to pass ATO mission scheduling information from PEX to UC2. Communications traffic between the two systems will be minimized the more complete the schedule is before the subscription occurs. !!! note Operational reporting requirements may dictate UC2 subscribing to an ATO before the schedule has been firmed. This is especially likely during periods of around the clock operations. Missions in PEX which are not associated with an ATO are called \u201cLocal Missions\u201d and those missions are passed to UC2 immediately upon creation, if a known MDS has been assigned. The following data enables certain actions: Assigning a mapped MDS to a sortie allows the mission to flow from PEX to UC2. Assigning a Tail number to a PEX sortie allows UC2 RMA to display the ATO SCL. The PEX load sets, SCLs, and Auto generated SCLs are of no interest to UC2 and are not shared. The Mission Number in UC2 allows for only 8 characters; if it is longer than 8 UC2 will not display the mission. The mission type assigned in PEX must be less than seven characters long or UC2 cannot display the type in RMA. When a mission is \u201cCommitted\u201d in PEX, UC2 will interpret that status as \u201cScheduled\u201d. Prior to that action, the UC2 status is \u201cTasked\u201d When the first sortie of a mission has an Actual Time of Departure entered in PEX, UC2 will interpret the mission status as \u201cTake Off\u201d; the earliest ATD will be forwarded to TBMCS-FL asb \u201cMission Actual Start Time\u201d When the last sortie of a mission has an Actual Time of Arrival entered in PEX, UC2 will interpret the mission status as \u201cLanded\u201d and the data will be forwarded to TBMCS-FL as \u201cMission End Time\u201d Maintenance Line numbers are used by EMOC to identify sorties in both UC2 and PEX, and these line numbers must be unique to an ATO period, which usual y does not correlate to a calendar day (Local or Zulu). ATO days can be from, for example, 06:00Z to 05:59Z. !!! note PEX has an \u201cAuto Line Number\u201d function which may result in violating this condition, dependent on the missions displayed, the ATO cycle and unit numbering conventions. Operations and Maintenance personnel must coordinate this process. The following information is displayed in UC2 RMA based on PEX scheduling information: Line number Mission Type (if less than 7 characters) Mission CNX (Cancelled) Assigned Squadron Call sign Flying period (only numeric, not alpha) MDS/Tail Number ATO SCL ATO Secondary SCL The first two crew members (if known to UC2, else UNKNOWN) Sortie Brief time Sortie scheduled and actual takeoff* Sortie takeoff and land location Sortie scheduled and actual landing Sortie CNX Sortie Remarks TTPs PEX permits operations which may or may not be in accordance with AOR operational procedures. For example, cancelling a local (non-ATO) mission through the use of the Mission Board \u201cCNX mission\u201d function would probably be an accepted practice, while performing the same action on an ATO mission would be outside the authority of unit schedulers. ATO missions are typically cancelled through an ATO change. Use of PEX and UC2 does not guarantee all operational directives will be complied with. PEX and UC2 displays wil not necessarily display the same missions, even though both systems contain the same missions. This is because of the use of Zulu versus Local times and various PEX filtering abilities such as \u201cShow Sorties by TO Date\u201d, \u201cFilter By Sortie Type\u201d, and \u201cFilter by MDS\u201d. EMOC can accept only unique line number/ATO date combinations. For example, two line numbers \u201c300\u201d during one ATO cycle wil be a problem even if they are on two different calendar dates. Use of PEX \u201cAuto Line Number\u201d function may result in duplicates which must be resolved manually. EMOC operators can perform a tail number swap between lines and they can enter/modify actual take off and land times on a sortie. If EMOC adds a tail number to a mapped unit and MDS, then UC2 will create the tail number and In PEX you will need to add the new tail number in the Aircraft Module. Then in the UC2 module you wil need to map it to the UC2 tail number. EMOC operators can modify aircraft status and that information will flow through UC2 to PEX. EMOC operators can perform a tail number swap between lines and they can enter/modify actual take off and land times on a sortie. If EMOC adds a tail number to a mapped unit and MDS, then UC2 wil create the tail number. In PEX you wil need to add the new tail number in the Aircraft Module and then in the U2 module you wil need to map it to the UC2 tail number. EMOC operators can modify aircraft status and that information will flow through UL to PEX. ATO mission information will be imported into PEX from a 2000/2004 or NATO ATO file. PEX then creates missions and sorties which appear on PEX mission/sortie displays. After scheduling manipulation in PEX, the UC2 operator will poll PEX for available ATOs and select the ATO of interest. They import the ATO and then the systems subscribe to changes. Al missions and sorties associated with the ATO of interest will flow to UC2, but only a subset of the data associated with those missions and sorties is exchanged. After that, any \u201cChange ATO\u201d or manual change to an ATO mission/sortie will automatically flow to UC2. At a certain point, UC2 passes ATO mission data to TBMCS-FL. There is no indication in PEX as to whether UC2 has subscribed to any particular ATO. See the ATO help topic for how to import an ATO.","title":"External Interfaces"},{"location":"PEX/Setup.html#labels","text":"Many of the tab names and column headers in PEX can be re-named.

Permissions PEXAdmin user has full permission to all squadrons in a database. Users with Administrator or Training Auditor/ARMS permission can Add, Edit or Delete items in this module. A Basic User can view their personal information without having access to others' information. They can add, edit and delete their contact information. Rules Personnel are identified by their ID#, normally the social security number. The ID# is unique to the database, meaning two personnel records cannot have the same ID#. !!! Caution Each person should have a single personnel record in the database. If a person has duties in multiple squadrons, they can be assigned permissions in those squadrons. If a person does have two personnel records, one record would require a \"dummy\" ID#. These records cannot be merged. An exception to this might be a person having two jobs in the same unit. For example, a person may be a contractor, while also holding a traditional ANG position. Module Notes Information contained in the Personnel module is referred to as a personnel record .

It cannot be assigned to a sortie. UD 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are User Defined. These columns can be used for any data with no existing field. UD 1, 2, 6 and 7 are dropdowns, configurable in the Setup tab. UD 3, 4, and 6 are free-text. Pri Exp Risk feeds the ORM module. Avail Enabled enables/disables availability for a specific person, for units with both active duty and reserve personnel. Teams enable individuals to be assigned to unit-defined teams. Unlike squadron, flight or office symbol, an individual an be assigned to multiple teams. Export AFTO 781 Data. Checking No blocks the export of 781 data for guest flyers, or people who fly with your unit but are not assigned to your unit. Exporting personnel data to the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) is accomplished by right-clicking on a row, selecting Export to DRRS, and saving the file to your local computer. Details This tab incorporates some of the functionality described in the Personnel module, plus is the primary tab for adding SEI and supervisor data. To add SEI identifiers, right-click in the SEI grid and select the appropriate identifier from the dropdown list. To select supervisors, right-click in the Supervisor grid, select the Fly Sq and Supervisor. This can also be accomplished in the Supervision tab. Duties This tab incorporates some of the functionality described in the Personnel module, plus adds Additional Duties. Right-click in the Additional Duties grid and select the desired duty. Contact This tab allows you to add multiple street addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. For each, right-click in the Addresses, Phone Numbers or Email Addresses grid. First select a Type, then fill in the appropriate information. !!! note Within each grid, each entry must have a unique type, such as Home or Work. I.e., a person cannot have more than one \"Home\" phone number. You can however, create additional types of, e.g., Home 1, Home 2, etc. in Setup. Quals This tab is were you can add and delete MDS/Crew Positions and related data. To be able to effective utilize personnel data in the various PEX modules, it is essential for all personnel records to have at least one MDS and Crew Position selected. One MDS/CP must be selected as Primary. Others can be added as required. If in ARMS, a person's qualification code and crew position is included in the ARMS import. MDS must be selected manually. If not in ARMS, or if the person holds multiple MDSs or crew positions, add an MDS/CP be selecting right-click, select Add, and fill in the required data. Status The Status tab is intended to identify people on Title 10 or Title 32 status, with inclusive dates, but can be used to identify people on any unit-status such as DNIF or Deployed. Right-click and select Add. When the dialog opens select the Status type, Effective Date and Expiration Date, and add any remarks. Supervision The Supervision tab allows you to designate supervisors. This is similar to the function in the Details tab. Here however, first select the Supervisor's Short Name in the dropdown. In the filterable Available Personnel grid, check the names of all people the person supervises, then click Assign. Those names will move to the Assigned Personnel grid. As a supervisor, you can view information on your supervisee's in My Page > Folders > My Supervisee's. This can also designate in-turn supervision. For example, Capt Mart\u00ecnez supervises MSgt Smith, who in turn supervises SrA Goldstein. First set Mart\u00ecnez as Smith's supervisor, then set Smith as Goldstein's supervisor. Roster The Roster tab is used to create, print and export-to-Excel rosters. In the columns grid, select the fields desired. Drag-and-drop the selected fields to the order desired. In the Sections grid, select Sections and Types. This can be used to select specific types, e.g., work and cel phone numbers while ignoring home and fax numbers. Setup This topic describes functionality in the Personnel > Setup tab. For more on how to setup the overall personnel module see the topic _____ . The Setup tab contains those data which populate the Personnel dropdowns. The Tables list equates to labels, or column headers. Selecting a table name displays the selections available for that label. NOTE: The selections are stored in the database Master List, so there is a single instance of each. When adding a selection to your squadron, you wil select it from the Master List. If it does not exist in your database, you will first create it in the Master List, then assign it to your squadron. To add a selection of, for example, 1A150 to DAFSC: Select DAFSC in the Tables grid. In the Listings grid, view a list of DAFSCs already assigned to your squadron. Right-click and select Add. The Master List opens, showing all DAFSCs in the database. If the desired DAFSC appears, check it and click OK (or Apply). If the desired DAFSC does not appear, Right-click in the Master List dialog and select Add. In the open Duty AF Specialty Code field, type in the required DAFSC, (in this case 1A150), check it and click OK. 1A150 appears in the DAFSC Table list, and will now appear in the DAFSC dropdowns. Setup - Configure Personnel for your unit Configure the display In the Personnel tab, right-click anywhere in the display area and select Grid Settings. Set number of people to display on a one-page view in Records per page field (set 999 to see all), then select Font size. Check the columns to display, then Save. The columns may be moved by left-mouse click/hold and drag on the column header. When the display is set, right-click and click Save Layout. The other tabs work the same way. Page Settings Click the Page Settings icon at upper-right and select Labels. Label Manager allows Grid Column Default Labels to be overridden with a custom label. For example, if there is a column you do not use, you could re-label it and use it to track something else. Close the module to save changes. Click \u201cLegend\u201d; the \u03a6 symbol indicates fields that are overwritten with each ARMS import. This is important to consider for data entry; a manual entry in an ARMS field will be retained until the next ARMS import (usually daily) overwrites it. Manage the Personnel list Click the funnel icon next to Page Settings to open the filter tool. The list can be narrowed-down by Crew Position, Flight, etc. An applied filter must be de-selected (click Clear Filter) to restore the full squadron list. Customize Dropdown Lists In the Personnel > Setup tab, select the selections you need in your squadron's dropdown lists. This is described in Personnel > Personnel Details by tab > Setup. If you are setting up more than one squadron, you can create the list in one squadron, then send to others. For each Table, right-click in the Listings grid and select View/Edit Master List. When it opens you can see which entries already exist in your database and which need to be added. Edit lists as desired. For each list, right-click in the Listings grid and select Send To. When the dialog opens, select the squadrons to receive your list. Click Send To. Go to those squadrons and confirm your lists transferred correctly. Populate with your squadron's personnel See Add, Move, Import and Export Personnel for options. Assign an MDS to each person. !!! note If this is a new squadron and your are adding an MDS for the first time, when you click off the row to save the first-added MDS, PEX will ask if you to assign that MDS to the remaining people in the squadron. This is the only point at which you have the option to mass-assign the MDS in that squadron. Assign crew position(s) as required. Add, Move, Import and Export Personnel Transfer Personnel data Personnel data can be added to PEX by: (I) Adding a person manually. (II) Importing people or a person with an ARMS file. (III) Importing individual personnel files from another PEX database. (IV) Exporting personnel information as a personnel file, and the file sent to another unit for import into their PEX database. (V) Moving personnel information from one squadron to another squadron within the same PEX database. Personnel information import, export and move general information The following rules govern personnel exports, imports and moves. Personnel data. Most personnel data moves: Names, Date of Birth,Gender, Rank, Civilian Grade, AFSC, Duty AFSC, Passport Number, Separation Date and Special Experience Identifiers. MDS/CP Qualifications. All Quals in Personnel are exported. If the gaining squadron has matching MDS and CP, Quals are imported. Certifications (Letter of X.) All certifications are exported as they are setup in the losing squadron\u2019s LoX. If the gaining squadron has matching Cert Name, MDS, CrewPosition and Status, then the certs import and are applied to the person. Non-matching LoXs are stored in database and are included in any future exports. Continuation Training Events. Al Unit Level tasks are exported, but they must be approved and audited (if auditing required). If the gaining squadron has matching Training Events (Task Code, Task Name, Program Codes) person is assigned the event. Non-matching events are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. These non-matching tasks can be viewed in the CT module. ARMS tasks are not exported as they can be imported into the gaining database through the normal ARMS import process. Qualification Training Courses. All data is exported (Historic Courses and Training Programs, Memos For Record, Person Training Documents, Scanned MFRs) but Courses must first be marked complete. Courses that are marked complete and their associated MFRs become historic after import. Qualification Training Task Lists. Open Task Lists move with all signatures and dates from the previous database. Form 623a Entries, CFETP Task Lists, Historic Training Programs, Memos For Record, Person Training Documents, Scanned MFRs move. Stan Eval. All data is exported (Certification Scans, Qualification Certificate Scans, Qualification Certificate Images, Record of Evaluation Scans, Memo for Record Images, Memo For Record Scans, Certifications, Person Crew Quals, Major Discrepancy Scans, Major Discrepancy Images, Minor Discrepancy Scans, Minor Discrepancies), but all MFRs and Major Discrepancies must be signed. Export is allowed with an open evaluation but the open evaluation itself is not exported. FCIF. Al FCIFs/IRFs are exported, but are subject to \u201cexact match\u201d rules upon import. Type, Number, and Subject must match exactly. Non-matching FCIFs are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. SEI. Al SEIs are exported, but are subject to \u201cexact match\u201d rules upon import. Non-matching SEIs are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. Exams. Exam data does not move and PEX does not prevent an export if the person has open exams. Completed evaluation requisite exam data moves, as part of the evaluation. Permission Roles. Roles do not move. (I) Add a person manually In the Personnel tab: Right-click in the Personnel tab, select Add, and you are taken to the Details tab. Click on the Details tab. Ensure you have the person's assigned squadron selected in the Fly Sq dropdown. Required: In the Details grid, enter a Short Name for the person. Typically, this is Firstname.Lastname (Ellen.Ripley) or LastnameFirstnameinitial (RipleyE). Although not required, this Short Name often matches the person's User Name in Users and Permissions. We recommend using the same naming convention for all personnel. Required: Enter the person's ID #. Typically, this is the person's social security number but can be any nine-digit number. This number must be unique in the database. If the number is not unique PEX displays an alert informing you of which squadron contains a person with that ID number. Save. Click Save & New to add another person. Click Save to save the entered required information and continue adding to the person's information. Not required but: Entering the following information is not required to save the record but is needed to effectively track and manage the person's information in PEX. Enter the person's First, Middle and Last Names. Click on the Quals tab and assign an MDS, Qualification Code, and Crew Position. Click on the Contacts tab and add an email address Other information such as Rank, etc. can be added as required. If the person needs a User Account (to enable login to PEX), you can now go to Users and Permissions and create the account. (I ) Import people or a person with an ARMS file This is covered in detail in ARMS- Configure your PEX-ARMS Interface. Configure the ARMS - PEX interface in Continuation Training > ARMS. This involves adding your unit's 17-character unit identifier so PEX can match that identifier to the PEX squadron. Extract your unit's personnel data from ARMS and save as a .csv file. Save the file to an accessible location on your computer or network. Import the file in Continuation Training > ARMS. Check the log file for any errors. Go to Setup > Personnel > Personnel tab and confirm any new people were successful y added. For the newly added personnel, go to Setup > Personnel > Quals tab and assign an MDS. (I I) Import individual personnel files from another PEX database This assumes you have received the person's data file from the losing unit and saved it to an accessible location on your computer or network. The naming convention is LastnameFirstinitial.pexdata. In the Personnel tab, right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select Import/Export > Import Personnel Data. When the Import Personnel Data dialog opens, browse to the .pexdata file. Click Begin Import. If the personnel record does not already exist, it wil be created. If the personnel record already exists, you will be given a warning that the all existing data will be overwritten and the opportunity to cancel the operation. The import brings in Unit Tasks, if there are matching Unit Tasks; FCIFs, if there are matching FCIFs; and SEIs, if there are matching SEIs. View the import log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Import Person Logs. Successful imports have a green check, unsuccessful imports have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. (IV) Export personnel data as a personnel file In the Personnel tab, right-click on the person and select Import/Export > Export Personnel Data When the Export Personnel Data dialog opens, click Begin Export. If there are any outstanding issues that need to be resolved, PEX will inform you (open training, open evaluations, open PEX courses, or unsigned MFRs). View the export log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Export Logs Personnel Data. Successful exports have a green check, unsuccessful exports have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. Save the resulting file (LastnameFirstinitial.pexdata) and send it to the gaining unit. After exporting a person\u2019s data you should move them to your inactive (PCS) squadron. See the Change Squadron topic below. We recommend you add a step in your out-processing checklists to accomplish this export. (V) Move personnel data from one squadron to another squadron (Change Squadron) People may be moved to another squadron in the same PEX database as long as they have no open training tasks (approve/export them), no open qualification courses (close out or un-enroll) or unsigned MFRs. In the Personnel tab, right-click on the person you want to move and select Change Squadron. In the dialog, note the correct person\u2019s name is selected. You can check/add more people at this point. Select the destination squadron from the list Click Change Squadron for Personnel, and Yes at the confirmation dialog. A progress indicator will launch. View the change log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Change Squadron Logs. Successful moves have a green check, unsuccessful moves have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. Personnel TTPs MDS and Crew Position MDSs are setup in the Maintenance > Aircraft module. For your MDS to appear in the Personnel module, it must be identified in Setup > Squadrons > Display MDS in Dropdowns column. Crew Positions are setup in Setup > Personnel > Setup > Crew Position. The selected squadron\u2019s list displays. Right-click to Add or Delete. Qual Codes are managed the same way through the Aircrew Qualification Code page. Assign a Crew Position to a person. For ARMS units, this is done through the ARMS import. Qual Codes are assigned the same way. For non-ARMS units, on the Quals tab, select from the dropdown list in Crew Pos and Qual Code fields, click off the line to Save. Assign an MDS by going to the Quals tab and selecting the person. Click in the MDS field and select the MDS. Click off the line to Save. People may be assigned multiple MDSs but only one can be marked as Primary. The bare minimum. Assign a single MDS/CP to a person. If the person accomplishes duties in other MDS/CP combinations, those should also be added. For example, the person may be qualified in different CPs in the same MDS. Each of 403 those should get a separate line item. The person may be qualified in the same CP in multiple MDSs. Each of those should get a separate line item. For each MDS/CP line item, identify characteristics such as: Qual Code, Experience, Weather Category, etc. These characteristics go along with the person\u2019s MDS/CP qualification, not just the person. How users can view and update their own information Anyone with a user account can view their personnel data and update their contact information. On My Page click the My Personal Data link. Users can view their data in the Details, Duties, Contact, Qual and Status tabs. They can add, edit and delete Addresses, Phone Numbers, and Email Addresses on the Contact tab. We suggest that personnel login to PEX at regular intervals and keep this information updated, especially the home email addresses, as this is where PEX sends notifications of scheduling changes, assigned exams, assigned evaluations, and late requisites. Remove a person leaving your unit When moving people to another database (e.g., PCS), as opposed to moving people from one squadron to another within the same database (e.g., PCA), that person's data file is exported and sent to the gaining unit. We recommend that the losing unit, instead of attempting to delete the person, move them to an inactive squadron in their unit's database. That squadron is created locally and is often called \"PCS\" or similar. This way their personnel record is still retrievable if necessary. Simply follow the instructions for Move a person from one squadron to another (Change Squadron), selecting the inactive squadron. Guest Flyers For \u201cGuest Flyers\u201d, add them as normal, then check the block for Do Not Export 781 Data and enter their home base HARM 781 Flying Orgn. When exporting 781s, their data will not export, even though they are on the 781. Build Unit Task Codes (UTC) in PEX UTCs may be built in PEX and exported to Excel for further manipulation and data entry. Go to Setup > Personnel > Setup, click Unit Task Code from the list 4. First, configure the grid: right-click, select Grid Settings, de-select all un-needed columns. Then, left-click, hold/drag columns to desired placement. Right-click, Save Layout. Right-click Add the UTC and ULNs The ULN, if single-digit, must be preceded by \u201c0\u201d Title (or Role) is free-text entry Squadron auto-fills with Unassigned Select Rank and PAFSC(s) Create in Excel. Right-click, select Export to Excel. Delete the Unassigned values in the Squadron column. This Excel sheet can now be filled with the names and squadrons of the actual people assigned to the deployment. More than one UTC. Add them all to PEX. Export the entire list to Excel and delete (in Excel) the undesired UTC records. Handle Inbound Deployed Personnel in your PEX Database Let\u2019s say you have a PEX database already in use at your base. Now some deployed personnel join your unit temporarily, such as an exercise or to sit alert. You can add them to PEX so that they can be scheduled and tracked for No-Go. Contact the person\u2019s home unit and obtain: A list of the person\u2019s Letter of X certifications. An extract, for just that person, of the unit\u2019s Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files from the PEX browsers. Append .CSV files. Open the Personnel .CSV extract file for the deployed person. Copy the data line(s) from the extract (not the header line). Open your unit's Personnel .CSV file and scroll to the bottom of the file. Paste the extract data beneath the last data line of the .CSV file and save. Repeat the steps for both the Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files. Import the .CSV extracts. Go to training > Continuation > ARMS > Settings and ensure your squadron is selected. In the Squadrons & ARMS Unit Identifiers field set, in the \u201cAdd ARMS unit to import into selected PEX squadron:\u201d text box, type in the 9-character ARMS unit code from the person\u2019s Personnel Flying Hours .CSV file and click Add. Then type in the 17-character ARMS unit code from the person\u2019s Training.CSV file and click Add. In the .CSV File field set, browse to your unit's appended Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files and click Save. Go to the Import view, and import Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours into your squadron. !!! Note In order to export this person\u2019s AFTO 781 flying hours and training tasks back into ARMS, you wil need permissions to the person\u2019s home station ARMS database. Usually, you will not have these permissions. Add Personnel Details. Go to Setup > Personnel > Details, select the new person, and add the following data: Arrival (date) and Departure (date). Assign the person a supervisor, if appropriate. Add Quals & Certs. Go to Setup > Personnel > Quals & Certs, and assign the person an MDS/Crew Position/WX Cat/Msn Ready Status (5.7+)/Experience (5.7+). Assign any Letter of X certifications that are applicable to your mission and organization.(Assigning an MDS/Crew Position will automatically assign this person all the FCIFs for that MDS/Crew Position. It also makes them available for flight scheduling.) Add Personnel Duties. Go to Setup > Personnel > Duties, and assign Pri Exp Ind (5.6-) and Msn Rdy Status (5.6-). Check the box \u201cDo Not Export 781 Data\u201d, enter the person\u2019s 781 Flying ORGN (can be bogus), and Save. Verify Applicable FCIFs are assigned. Go to Ops > FCIF and filter for that person\u2019s MDS/Crew Position to verify the person shows up in the list and is assigned all the appropriate FCIFs. Assign Required Unit Level Tasks. Go to Training > Continuation > Unit Task Assignment and assign the person any Unit Tasks required by your unit. Verify Personnel Flying Hours Status. Go to Scheduling > Reports > Personnel Flying Hours and run the report to make sure the new person shows up in the list. Note any potential problem with high flying time that might arise and develop a plan to manage it. Verify Training Tasks Status. Go to Training > Continuation > Training Tasks, ensure your squadron is selected, and click the \u201cClear Filter\u201d button in the top right of the screen if it is in view. Verify the person you just imported is listed. At the top left of the screen, change the date to the person\u2019s scheduled Departure Date from step 3 above. Note all the training events that will go overdue while the person is deployed to your location and develop a plan to keep the person current on the ones that matter to you. PEX User Login. If you want the person to be able to login to PEX for viewing the schedule, entering and acknowledging commitments, taking exams, etc.: Ensure the person has a Windows account to log on to the computers. Add a PEX User Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Users and add the person as a PEX User. Associate the PEX Users Account to the Windows Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Windows Accounts and associate the PEX User you just added to the person\u2019s Windows account. (Assigning the person a PEX user account wil allow them to sign off PEX FCIFs.) Associate Permissions to the PEX User Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Permissions and make sure the person has the permissions required for duty (at least Basic User to the squadron). Assign Exams. Go to Stan Eval > Testing Admin > Exam > Assigned Exams and assign the person all the appropriate tests. This checklist is based on the assumption that no formal upgrades or evaluations are conducted on the inbound deployed person. If that is not the case, the person would need to be assigned to a PEX Qualification Training course and/or assigned a PEX Stan Eval evaluation. Aircraft. If the personnel bring their own airplanes, go to Maintenance > Aircraft > Aircraft and add the MDS, if not already listed. Fill in the ARMS MDS field. Select the squadron the airplane belongs to, add the tail number(s) (fil in the ARMS ID) and select any squadrons that may share the tail number. Redeployment. When the person leaves, go to Setup > Personnel and change the person\u2019s Fly Sq to the \u201cPCS\u201d squadron or equivalent. If you don\u2019t have a PCS squadron in PEX, go to Setup > Squadrons and add it. When the aircraft leaves, go to Maintenance > Aircraft > Aircraft > Tail Number, uncheck any Shared Squadrons, uncheck the box for \u201cShow in Dropdown\u201d and change the Squadron to PCS.","title":"Personnel"},{"location":"PEX/Setup.html#reports","text":"Reports Overview Introduction Currently, most functional areas (Scheduling, Training, etc.) include a Reports module, containing all forms and reports for that function.

Resources are people, places and things that can be scheduled in the Scheduler. Resource Types are categories of resources, such as people, airspace and aircraft. Resource Groups are collections of resources. The actual resources are added to PEX in their respective modules; People in Personnel, Airspace in Locations, Aircraft in Maintenance, etc. In the Resources module, you first associate resources to a resource type, then associate resources to one or more groups. For example, you can create a hard crew group with four persons, then schedule them as a group instead of individual y, similar to Crew Sets in legacy scheduling modules. Controls Access these procedures by navigating to Setup > Resources. Module Notes A resource group consists of a single type of resource. For example, a Group can contain Persons or Workstations, but not Persons and Workstations. Resources are used only in the Scheduler module. They do not apply to legacy scheduling modules.

Enter an Installation name, e.g., \u201cEglin AFB, FL\u201d. (Optional but recommended) Enter the ICAO identifier, e.g., \u201cKVPS\u201d. (Optional but recommended) Select a Group name from the drop down. (Optional but recommended) Select a Service. (Optional but recommended) Enter number of Aircraft the squadron possesses. (Optional) Enter number of Personnel for the squadron. (Optional) Enter SunRiseBASH and SunSetBASH times. This is the estimated duration in minutes that Bird Air Strike Hazard occurs. This data is calculated and then displayed in the scheduling areas of PEX. (Optional) Enter Flt Lead Symbol and Deputy Lead Symbol. This data will display on flight authorization forms. (Optional) Select MDSs in Display MDS in Dropdowns. These are the MDSs your squadron wil see throughout PEX. Enter POC Name, POC Email and POC Phone fields. This data is used for the MAJCOM Registration and the POC Information on the PEX Navigation Menu. (Optional) Unit type. Select from a list to further define the squadron. (Optional) Unit Identification Code (UIC). Enter your UIC. (Optional) Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) System. Enter your PAS. (Optional) Include Readiness Data in Export. Check this box if you are establishing a NIPR to SIPR connection and wish to export readiness data. Otherwise leave it unchecked. Squadrons Availability Periods Availability periods, up to six, are used to describe blocks of time where personnel can identify when they are available to be scheduled. These periods are identified by the schedulers. Then, part-time personnel (think ANG and AFRC) can identify when they are available using those periods. The periods can overlap. Example periods are: Period: 00:00 \u2013 23:59 Periods (AM, PM, and Night): 05:00-12:00, 11:00-18:00, 17:00-23:59 Enter your squadron\u2019s Availability Periods Highlight the Squadron in the Squadron\u2019s grid Place the cursor in the Availability Periods grid, right-click and select Add. An Add Availability Period dialog will appear. Set the number of periods and set the start/end time for each period. Periods can (and usually do) overlap. For example, if you end one period at 09:00 and start the next at 09:01, it creates a gap of one minute and PEX will think personnel are unavailable for that one minute. Using this example, you should end the first period at 09:00 and start the second at 09:00. Periods can run from 00:00 to 23:59 (they cannot cross midnight). Click OK when finished. There can be up to six periods identified for a squadron. !!! NOTE Once saved, the periods cannot be edited. Instead, new Availability Periods set must be created to replace the old. Personnel and schedulers can use only the latest set for data entry. Old sets are displayed for historical purposes.","title":"Squadrons"},{"location":"PEX/Setup.html#squadrons-hq-registration","text":"Use HQ Registration to send your Scheduling and Training data to your MAJCOM.

User accounts can one of two types. An individual account, allowing a person log in and view their information in PEX. A joint-use account, which can be used by multiple people. Because multiple people can use it, joint-use accounts cannot be associated to a Personnel record. Permissions Users with Administrator permission to any squadron can access this page. However, they can see only those squadrons to which they have permission. Rules Users cannot change their own permissions. That must be done by PEXAdmin. Multiple people can be associated to the PEXAdmin user account. Users can be assigned the role of Administrator in individual squadrons. People assigned the Administrator role should be trained and experienced PEX users. Every squadron should have at least two people assigned the Administrator role. Workspace Users. Add User accounts for people who need to log in to PEX. Associate them to Personnel records so they can see their information. Permissions. Grant users the level of access required to perform their duties in PEX. CAC Accounts. Allow users to log in with a Common Access Card (CAC). This is useful when users cannot log in via an AFNet account. Windows Accounts. Al ow users to log in with a Windows domain account. This is the most common method. Joint-use accounts. These are not associated to an individual. Individual accounts. These are associated to individual Personnel records. !!! note Although not normal y required, users can be associated to both CAC and Windows logins if desired. Workflow Manage User Accounts Create Permission templates Create Permission templates to apply to new users: Go to Users and Permissions > Permissions tab. Check the Basic User role for your squadron. Click Save as New Template and call it \u201cBasic User (squadron name)\u201d.4. Repeat as required for various combinations of roles and squadrons. Add a User account Go to Users and Permissions > Users tab. Right-click and select Add User. In the Add User dialog, select the desired Default Template. Enter your email extension, e.g., @us.af.mil. Select your email convention, e.g., First.Last Person Associated. For individual person accounts, associate the user account to a Personnel record. If the person will accomplish activities in PEX (scheduled for commitments, training folder, Stan Eval folder, etc.), ensure they have a Personnel record in the Personnel module. Skip this step if the person will not accomplish activities in PEX but only login to PEX to see information (Air Traffic Control, Base Operations, Inflight Kitchen, etc.) For Joint Use Accounts, skip to User Details. Select the squadron to which the person is assigned. Select their Short Name from the dropdown. This list includes all persons who have a Personnel record but do not have a user account. User Details. PEX populates these fields. Make any desired changes to: User Name Email Full Name Loc.

Workflow Stan Eval Management \u00b6 SEM Basics \u00b6 Introduction The Stan Eval Management (SEM) module enables you to administer a comprehensive Standardization and Evaluation program in accordance with Air Force Instructions. You can create, assign, grade, record and track evaluations. Configure PEX for your unit\u2019s stan/eval program, tailored by Squadron, MDS and Crew Position. Exams are managed in Testing Admin and Testing. Evaluation reports are generated in Stan Eval Reports. Further SEM guidance is in: Stan Eval Setup - How to configure PEX for your unit. Stan Eval Overview - How to manage your Stan Eval program. Stan Eval Personnel - How to use controls to navigate evaluations and related functions. Stan Eval Tactics, Techniques and Procedures - How to conduct various evaluations and related functions. Permissions Three permission roles can access Management, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator: Stan Eval Administrator - Can perform any function in SEM. Stan Eval Examiner - Is similar but cannot edit settings in Setup. Stan Eval Examiner can however, view, print and change displays in Setup. Stan Eval Read Only - Can print and change displays throughout SEM but cannot edit. Permission roles are assigned in Users & Permissions. Examiners are selected in Preferences > Eval Forms. We suggest only persons with training in this module be given Stan Eval Administrator as some actions are difficult if not impossible to reverse. Stan Eval Read Only is intended for staff or HHQ inspectors who need only view data. Users not assigned a Stan Eval role can still view their own evaluation folder. Rules Users cannot grade their own evaluations. A grayed-out entry indicates it is in use and cannot be edited or deleted. Entries with gray backgrounds are required by AFI, shipped with the software, and cannot be edited. Unit-added entries can be edited. Module Notes SEM pulls data from other PEX modules: Maintenance > Aircraft - Verify the list the MDSs needed for Stan Eval. Some communities (e.g., aeromed) do not use the Series letter. By listing the MD and S characters separately you can control individual preferences in SEM. Hyperlink Setup > Squadrons - Hyperlink Installation column, ensure your location is correct for your evaluation forms. Display MDS in Dropdowns column, ensure your MDS(s) are checked for display. Setup > Personnel > Personnel tab. Hyperlink Service Status column, identify each person as A - Active Duty, R - Reserve, or G -Guard. \u201cA\u201d is the default. MDS and CP columns, ensure each person has the correct MDS and CP. If you need to assign or change data, go to the Quals tab. Each person must have at least one MDS/CP set as Primary. Additional MDS/CP combinations can be as added as required. Setup > Users & Permissions Hyperlink Set permissions as desired. Evaluation folder import from another PEX database is included as part of personnel data file import in Setup > Personnel . !!! danger \"Warning\" PEX allows you to reopen closed evaluations. This deletes all signatures and revisions from the form. We recommend not reopening and closing evaluations completed in an earlier version of PEX as this can cause unanticipated results. For example, a person may appear to be qualified and current in all parts of SEM except for the Rainbow Unqualified panel list. Creating and deleting a SPOT eval on the person may resolve the issue. Workspace These features are accessed by navigating to Stan Eval > Management. Home - Central display of all SEM pages. Overview - Stan Eval program management functions, overview of processes and timelines. Personnel - Administer evaluations. Setup - Configure how your squadron will execute Stan/Eval program. Search and Pushpin - Search for people by name. When \u201cpinned\u201d opens SEM to the pinned page. Throughout SEM you have a choice of executing commands with either menu buttons or a right-click context menu. The following instructions are written around \u201cbest practices.\u201d Save - Most modules save data when clicking off a line but a few have Save buttons. Expand/Collapse All - Most SEM pages have a blue, expand-and-collapse-all-grids button at the center/top of the page grids. User name - The user names display throughout SEM are links to the person\u2019s Person Details page. SEM uses the \u201cvisibility\u201d model to display options. Instead of adding multiple instances of the same item (e.g., a new eval type) to a database, a single instance of an item is added and made visible to the squadrons using it. This simplifies moving people between squadrons within a database. You must have SE permission to a squadron in order to view it in Setup. When a person is added to your database from another PEX database via a Personnel Data File import, any Stan/Eval data will be automatically added. Likewise, if a person leaves your database for another, their Personnel Data File will include Stan/Eval data.

Stan Eval Rules When checked: All requisites required to be complete before primary evaluation for INIT and RQ evaluations. PEX will pop a warning if setting the eval complete with incomplete requisites. Non-periodic eval reqs required to be complete NLT 2 months (3 months ANG/AFRC) after the eval flght is complete. The Service Status is set in Setup > Personnel. With the rule not checked, non-periodic evaluation requisites are due not later than three months after the primary evaluation is completed (date of the last worksheet). With rule checked: Person Serving Status Primary Eval Complete Date Requisite Late Date Alpha null 1-Jan-20 1-May-20 Bravo A - Active Duty 1-Jan-20 1-Apr-20 Charlie R - Reserve 1-Jan-20 1-May-20 Delta G - Guard 1-Jan-20 1-May-20 Use the 12-month cycle based on the birth date. Evaluations wil expire every twelve months, on the examinee's birth month. Failed Requisite = Overall Q3. When a requisite is failed, the overall evaluation grade will be set to \u201c3\u201d. When the requisite is subsequently passed, the overal grade will reflect a \u201c3/1\u201d. This rule is usually used by MAF, AMC, and AMC-gained ANG/AFRC units. Additional training required to be complete not later than 2 months (3 months ANG/AFRC) after the primary evaluation. The Service Status is set in Setup > Personnel. With the rule not checked, additional training is due no later than three months after the discrepancy date. With rule checked: Person Service Status Person Serving Status Discrepancy Date Additional Training Due Date Alpha null 1-Jan-20 30-Apr-20 Bravo A - Active Duty 1-Jan-20 28-Feb-20 Charlie R - Reserve 1-Jan-20 30-Apr-20 Delta G - Guard 1-Jan-20 30-Apr-20 Overdue or Failed evaluations place personnel in NoGo state (Red Ball). In NoGo, persons with overdue or failed evaluations display NoGo/red instead of caution/yellow . Show personnel with missing qualifications as Caution (Yellow Ball). In NoGo, persons with MDS/CP qualifications in Setup > Personnel > Quals and no corresponding qualification in SEM will display caution/yellow. !!! note \"Note\" If \u201cOverdue or Failed evaluations place personnel in \"NoGo state\u201d is checked, \u201cShow personnel with missing qualifications\u201d switches from Caution (Yellow Ball) to NoGo state (Red Ball). Show qualifications within 30 days of expiration as Caution (Yellow ball). In NoGo, persons with qualifications that expire within thirty days will show yellow. If on a wavier, NoGo uses the wavier expiration date. Use the Failed Requisite Exam preference. Go/No-Go shows No-Go (red) or Caution (yellow), as selected with the radio buttons, for failed requisite exams. If unchecked, Go/No-Go shows green. !!! caution \"Caution\" PEX already identifies personnel as NoGo (red) if they have a failed a requisite CAPS/Boldface/EPE. If unchecked, there is no indication of failed requisite exams in Go/No-Go. The failed requisite exam does not need to be part of an open evaluation to change the Go/No-Go indicator. For personnel with multiple crew positions, PEX takes into account the MDS and crew position associated with the requisite exam. A successful re-take of the same Type (including MDS/CP) requisite exam will restore the Go/No-Go status to green. !!! note \"Note\" Entering a passing or failed grade manually on an individual\u2019s Eval Details > Requisites will not affect the No-Go indicator. It the exam is taken on paper, enter it in PEX as an Offline Exam so it feeds No-Go. Periodic Evaluation Expiration Enter the number of months for which an evaluation is valid. For a 17-month cycle, enter 18 (not 17). This determines the expiration date for this evaluation. Eligibility Zone Enter the number of eligibility zone months for periodic evaluations. For aircrew and ISR units, enter 6. Default Eval Form Select AF Form 8, 8a, 4350 or 4143. This will be the default for your squadron but can be changed on individual evaluations and on an individual\u2019s Person Details. For aircrew, pick Form 8. For ISR units, pick Form 4350. Eval Form Signature Mode Select whether you want to use digital (CAC) signatures or manual (pen-and-ink) signatures on the evaluation form. Digital is preferred. !!! caution \"Caution\" When switching modes, any evaluation with some but not all signatures will dump those signatures. In other words, an evaluation form must have all digital or all manual signatures. This does not affect evals with all signatures in place. Display MDS Series Letter For example, C-130H. Selecting No will display C-130, selecting Yes will display C-130H. For A2-directed ISR units, pick No unless you are in an F-15E unit. Email Zone Notification Template and Email Late Requisites Template Edit the default emails sent when people enter their zone or are late on requisites. Use the buttons across the top to enter variables into the email. For ISR units, make the text edits which are directed in the PEX ISR SEM checklist Set up Preferences. Additional Eval Reviews Setup a pre- and post- signature form review process. Whatever you enter here will be appended to the Additional Comments on the evaluation form. Pre-signature reviews, up to eight, must be completed before the examiner is allowed to digitally sign the form. The Posted review is activated after the examinee\u2019s signature is on the form. In both cases a Review button activates when appropriate. Clicking Review registers the user account name of the person logged in. This cannot be a joint use account. For example, you are associated to multiple user accounts including yourself and PEXAdmin. If logged in as yourself you can sign off the review. If logged in as PEXAdmin you cannot. Click Add one and enter the reviewer\u2019s office symbol. To add more, right-click and select Add . The order entered will be the order displayed. To edit a reviewer, highlight the record and make the necessary changes. To delete a reviewer, highlight the record, right-click, and select the delete action. Display Additional Reviewers on Form 8. If not checked, the reviewers display in the GUI but not the eval form. Require a \u201cPosted\u201d entry. When checked, activates the Post review process. Do not show evaluation form in Section II of the FEF until the post review action is complete. This is not active unless Require a \u201cPosted\u201d entry is checked. The link to the evaluation will still be visible in the Eval Forms/MFR grid on the person details page. Restriction Templates Click Add one and add formatted restrictions for the reverse side of eval forms. Assoc Eval Types/Reqs This page associates eval types and requisites with individual MDS/CP combinations. The combinations are universal throughout the database; squadrons listed in the navigation panel serve only to display and filter MDS and CP. Once configured in one squadron, that MDS/CP combination will show the same configuration in all squadrons. For example, you associate CV-22B pilots in squadron X to a QUAL with Open Book and Closed Book requisites. CV-22B pilots in squadrons Y and Z wil have the same QUAL/Open Book/Closed Book combination. !!! caution \"Caution\" The above paragraph means that if you change the associations in your squadron, they will change for all other squadrons in your database with that MDS/CP. Click Add/Edit Eval Types. When the Edit dialog opens check/uncheck the Eval Type and click Save. Click Add/Edit Requisites if the Eval Type has a Ground or Knowledge Phase requisite. When the Edit dialog opens check/uncheck the Requisite(s) and click Save. If the Eval Type or Requisite is no longer required, click the red X box and confirm. Exclude from Tracking Desired Month Completion. As set in Preferences, requisites show as late once past their desired tracking month. If you do not want a requisite tracked and displayed as late, check this box. For example, the EPE is done in conjunction with the flight evaluation, not with the other requisites. Mission Description Select Squadron, MDS and CP. Click Add, Edit or Delete Mission Description. The Add dialog opens, already associated to the selected Squadron, MDS and CP. Enter a Name. This is the name evaluators will use when selecting a mission description for a worksheet. Enter the description. This is the description evaluators will add to the worksheet. Once added, the description can be edited for individual evaluation worksheets without affecting the template description. Mission Description Tactics, Techniques and Procedures: Use CTRL-v to paste data into the Mission Description field. A useful technique is to use an underscore or similar for variables. For example, \u201cThe evaluation was conducted in the ______ MOA.\u201d Eval Forms For each person: Stan Eval Form - Select the appropriate evaluation form (Forms 8, 8a, 4143, or 4350) for an individual, if different from the squadron default. Eval Form Org - Enter the person\u2019s desired signature block, but only if the person requires one different than their squadron/office default. Service - Change if not USAF (e.g., USMC). This entry appears on the eval form reverse when the evaluator is the first of two evaluators on one evaluation. To populate the various dropdowns, check people who are designated as: Reviewing Officer. Final Approving Officer. Default Reviewing Officer - This name will always appear the top of the dropdown list. Default Approving Officer - This name will always appear the top of the dropdown list. Examiner. Add Tng Officer / Cert Official - Additional Training Certifying Official. Check the Show Only Active Certs box to display only those people with a checked entry. Eval Criteria \u00b6 This page associates MDS/CP evaluation criteria from the applicable AFI for inclusion on eval worksheets and draft eval forms. The criteria can be created here but most are on the PEX website. If your MDS/CP file is not on the web site, contact the PEX Help Desk to have it built. !!! note \"Note\" The older .xml files can still be imported but are being replaced by the current .evalcrit type. Be aware that, if you import an older .xml format file with profiles, those profiles will import but cannot be edited or deleted. Applying new criteria from the Evaluation Criteria Tool tab will overwrite the old eval criteria, removing all existing profiles for that MDS/CP. Each area, or subarea, has a name, sequence number and grading criteria. It may also have a Description and Notes. Areas/subareas marked as Critical can be graded \u201cQ\u201d or \u201cU\u201d but not \u201cQ-.\u201dGrading uses the standard AF Stan/Eval system. This is a guide; reference the applicable AFI for specifics. Q - Indicates the examinee demonstrated satisfactory knowledge and performance. Q - Indicates the examinee is qualified but requires debriefing or additional training. U - Indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters. An examinee receiving a grade of U requires debriefing or additional training, as determined by the examiner. Evaluation Criteria Tool Tab New - Create a new eval criteria file. Open - Open an eval criteria file stored locally. Save - Save the eval criteria you are working on as an .evalcrit file. This saves as a file on your computer but it is not saved in PEX. Apply - Apply the eval criteria you are working to a squadron, MDS and crew position. Add Section - A grouping of grading areas. It does not have criteria or receive a grade. Add Subsection - A sub-group of a section. It does not have criteria or receive a grade. Add Area - A gradable criteria. However, if an area has subareas, the area is not gradable Add Subarea - A gradable criteria which is a sub-group of an area. Evaluation Criteria Tab After eval criteria is created or imported in the Evaluation Criteria Tool, use the Evaluation Criteria tab to create profiles and apply the set to a squadron, MDS and crew position. A profile determines which areas/subareas appear on a worksheet. Required and Desired criteria appear on the worksheet, N/A criteria does not. For example, for an instructor upgrade eval, select only the instructor areas as Required. You must have at least one profile. Click Add Profile . When the dialog opens, name the profile. Select each area/subarea as Required, Desired or N/A. Import Eval Criteria. Imports only the older .xml file types. Overview- Manage Your Stan Eval Program \u00b6 StanEval Overview Tab \u00b6 Overview provides a high-level view of your Stan/Eval program.

Trending \u00b6 PEX does not have a separate trend entry function. Any worksheet area or subarea graded Q- or U will feed Trending. Trend by Discrepancies Trend by a combination of sample size and percent, or minimum number. Sample Size & Percent Sample Size - The minimum number of times an area is graded before it is considered for trending. For example, if your minimum sample size is five (5) and the area was graded only four (4) times during the time period, it won't show up on your trending data, even if it was downgraded all four times. Percent - The percentage of times the evaluation area was downgraded. For example, if set to 50%, and the area was evaluated four times, and downgraded only once (25%), it won't show up on your trending data. Minimum Number - The minimum number of times an evaluation area is downgraded before it is considered for trending. For example, if your Minimum Number is ten (10), and the area was evaluated 100 times but downgraded only nine (9) times, it won't show up on your trending data. To get al downgraded areas to show up, simply select Minimum Number = 1 . Enter the desired Date range. Select the desired Eval Types. Click Trend . The downgraded areas section displays the area title, area number, number of times graded, and the number of times graded Q- and U .

It is set up so that training assignments can be done via an Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) training import, HQ CT file import, and/or by manually assigning PEX generated Unit-Level Training tasks to personnel. Permissions \u00b6 New in 5.16.1 A new role of ARMS Import/Export is added, and Training Auditor/ARMS is renamed to Training Auditor. Several permission roles can access the Continuation Training module and perform administrative functions, in addition to PEX Admin and Administrator. The pseudo-role Supervisor also has limited functions in the CT module, and any Basic User can access the module for the purpose of submitting Training Accomplishment Reports (TARs) via the Reporting tab: ARMS Import/Export is required to access the ARMS tab. This role cannot be assigned to a Joint Use account, i.e., the user must be associated to a Personnel record. Training Administrator can perform any function in the CT module except audit TARs and access the ARMS tab. Training CT Administrator can perform any function in the CT module except audit TARs, setup and use the TACTICS tab, and access the ARMS tab. Training Auditor (previously Training Auditor/ARMS) can audit TARs for both unit-level and ARMS tasks, import and export ARMS data, as well as view Training Tasks and Overview tabs. It cannot access the ARMS tab. Basic User can access and use the Training Tasks tab within the module, as well as submit TARs for squadron personnel via the Reporting tab. Supervisor is a pseudo-role which is assigned in the Personnel module. In addition to the functions of Basic Users, individuals assigned as a supervisor can also the access the CT tab of their supervisees\u2019 training folders from which they can view subordinate\u2019s CT status, generate daily and monthly TAR reports and view the status of tasks reported but not yet updated in PEX displays. If the unit has set up the CT module to allow it, supervisors may also audit TARs of their supervisees from within the training folder. Module Notes \u00b6 The CT module interfaces with and uses data from the Personnel module. For ARMS tasks, the ARMS Personnel imports add/overwrite the necessary Personnel dat1.

ADLS tab: The ADLS tab allows you to import ADLS training data with a .CSV file downloaded from ADLS. Personnel can log ADLS training accomplished in PEX (if desired) and/or continue to import updated ADLS files to update ADLS task completion in PEX. TACTICS tab: TACTICS is used by the Joint Terminal Air Controller (JTAC) community to track training. PEX can import TACTICS training and physical dat1. Training Tasks tab: The Training Tasks tab provides you with a micro view of your unit\u2019s training progression. It lists all your personnel and all their training tasks. You can use personnel and task filters to look at just the data in which you are interested. Right-clicking on any of these grids allows you to select which columns to display, print, or export to Excel. Overview tab: The overview tab provides you with a macro view of your unit\u2019s training progression for the current cycle. The page is broken down into three sections: Proficiency, Currency, and One-Time tasks. Buttons, at top-right of each section allow you to expand any of these sections. Right-clicking on any of these grids allows you to select which columns to display, print, or export to Excel. Setup tab: The Setup Tab is used to set unit training cycle, unit preferences, modify lists, view imported ARMS tasks, import HQ unit level tasks, create local tasks, set RAP requirements, SIM/RAP rules and setup for the display of effective mission ready status. PEX - ARMS Interface \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 New in PEX 5.16.1. PEX now includes connectivity to ARMS via Web Services. This allows users to easily exchange data between ARMS and PEX without using the process of importing data using ARMS-generated CSV files and exporting data using ODA3. This CSV/Virtual Account process remains in place, but has been updated. The ARMS tab is used to setup the PEX interface with ARMS to send data from ARMS to PEX, and PEX to ARMS. There are two interface functions. Send validated personnel, personnel flying hours, and training data from ARMS to PEX. Send audited training accomplishments and AFTO 781 data from PEX to ARMS. There are two interface methods. CSV/Virtual Account. This is the legacy method used in previous versions of PEX. CSV. Export data from ARMS into a CSV file, then manually import the file into PEX. Virtual Account. Export the data from PEX to ARMS using a virtual account. Due to the USAF requirement for two-factor authentication, this option may sunset, or become unavailable, in the near future. If Virtual Accounts are unavailable export data using Web Services described next. Web Services. Establish a direct connection/interface between PEX and ARMS. Once configured, the import and export are respectively accomplished by simply clicking the Begin Import and Begin Export buttons. Although the CSV/Virtual Account process remains essentially the same, both the interface and permission roles have been revised. Persons using the CSV/Virtual Account method should thoroughly review this topic before attempting import or export. The PEX CSV/Virtual Account and Web Services imports for Personnel and Training behave differently. With the CSV/Virtual Account method, Personnel and Training CSV imports are a complete download from ARMS every time. PEX \u201cwipes\u201d and replaces person training assignments data on every import. ARMS Web Services, on the other hand, only import Personnel and Training records which have been updated in ARMS since the Zulu date specified in the Web Service Imports dialog. For example; Personnel - Import records updated in ARMS since (date) Z. !!! note NOTE ARMS Web Services returns all squadron personnel in each Training import, as ARMS refreshes daily to Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS) dat1. As a result, each Web Services Training import into PEX updates all persons' Aviation Service data in Personnel and Z-004 ASC Term Date. Users using the Web Services method must configure the CSV/Virtual Account method as well. The CSV/Virtual Account method is used: When a squadron is starting to use PEX for the first time. For the first training import at the start of each training cycle. For the first training import after migration to 5.16.1. Permissions \u00b6 ARMS Import/Export is a new permission role. This role allows access to the Continuation Training > ARMS tab and the Import, Export, and Setup buttons. Therefore, this applies to both CSV/Virtual Account method and new Web Services method Training Auditor is the renamed Auditor/ARMS role. Functionality remains unchanged. !!! NOTE Both ARMS Import/Export and Training Auditor roles are required in order to export or import ARMS dat1. For security reasons, the Administrator role alone does not give the ability to import or export ARMS dat1. Rules \u00b6 Users using only the CSV/Virtual Account method can disregard the Web Services specific information. Users can choose an override method when actually importing and exporting (from the Begin Import and Begin Export buttons). It is recommended users choose the default method they will routinely use, then override as required. Users using either the CSV/Virtual Account or Web Services method must have both ARMS Import/Export and Training Auditor permissions as described above.

Setup \u00b6 Web Services Network Setup Interface Web services utilizes Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Authentication, which requires certificate information in the form of a Thumbprint for the PEX Service Host (PSH) server. The ARMS Program Management Office requires certificate information in the form of a Thumbprint for each PSH server. Here, the term \"PSH Admin\" refers to the local person or persons who administer the PEX Service Host. Typically, this is the local PEX Administrator in conjunction with the local communications squadron. The PSH Admin: Coordinates with the PEX Help Desk to send them: Required server certificate information. HARM codes associated with that certificate. Works with one HARM office from each PEX database and provides the HARM office with a certificate Thumbprint specific to their PSH. The designated HARM office for the PEX database: Enters the certificate Thumbprint in the Continuation Training > ARMS tab > Settings page. The Thumbprint has to be entered only once for the database. The Thumbprint is then visible to, and used by, every squadron in the database. !!! CAUTION This value is used by all squadrons in the database. Changes should be made with care as they affect all units in the database. Import from ARMS to PEX \u00b6 !!! NOTE A CSV Training import is required for initial use, even if you plan to use Web Services on a daily basis. Adhoc View/Reports will be in Jaspersoft and accessible to all ARMS users worldwide. Users will access these reports to generate the three.csv files: Personnel, Training, and 7-30-60-90 Personnel Flight Hours. Users must schedule the reports in ARMS.

Setup the Virtual Account export from PEX to ARMS \u00b6 To transfer data from PEX to ARMS, users must have the following setup. A virtual account for ARMS. ODAC downloaded and installed on the machine. Firewall Exemption Letter. Allow network traffic from the machine (origination) being used for ARMS export and the destination IP address of the ARMS database. The exchange occurs via bi-directional mode through Port 1521. The instructions for this is not included in this document. You wil need to contact your network administrator to make this happen. PEX Installed. User must know how to report and audit training and 781 hours in PEX, then export the data to ARMS. Virtual Account for ARMS In order to export data from PEX to ARMS, the ARMS User must have an ARMS Virtual Account User Name and Password. This is not the same as the ARMS account used to connect to ARMS. An ARMS Administrator can create these accounts in ARMS at System > Security > ARMS External Accounts. The virtual account is set to \u201cT\u201d for True. A User ID is created along with a Password. The IRA Number used is 11. In PEX, the same account user name and password from Step 2 above is what you wil enter in: Training > Continuation > ARMS tab > Export > Virtual Account User Name and Password. Download ODAC ODAC needs to be installed at the following locations: SQL Server (Required) hosting PEX. Webserver (Required) hosting ePEX. WinPEX (Optional).

Import ARMS data to PEX \u00b6 If using the CSV/Virtual Account method, first export the data from ARMS as an Excel worksheet (XLS), and then save it as a CSV file to an accessible location on a computer or network. Go to Training > Continuation > ARMS tab > Import button. Under Squadrons [Default Setting], select the squadron(s) whose data is to be imported. Each squadron displays, in brackets, the default method selected in the ARMS tab > Settings. You can override these below. Under Data Types, select the type of data (All, Personnel, Training, and/or Personnel Flying Hours) to import. Under Import Selected Squadrons Using, select: Each Squadron's default settings. This will import via CSV file or Web Services as selected above. Web services for all . This will import via Web Services regardless of the Default Setting above. CSV files for all. This will import via CSV files regardless of the Default Setting above. Click Begin Import. For squadrons importing via Web Services, the Web Service Imports window will open. Web Service imports require the Zulu Dates of the last successful imports of Personnel and Training records. ARMS Web Services only import Personnel and Training records which have been changed in ARMS since the Zulu date specified in the Web Service Imports dialog. Blank dates indicate the squadron has not yet completed a Web Services import for that data type (Personnel or Training). To ensure a squadron's first web service import includes all records changed in ARMS since the squadron's last CSV import, refer to the log file for the squadron's last successful CSV import for each data type. At the top of each log file locate the \"Data Downloaded from ARMS\" date. This is the date/time of the last ARMS import. If the last import was completed in PEX v5.16.1 or later, the date/time is in Zulu. You can enter that date as it is. If the last import was completed in PEX v5.16.0 or earlier, the date/time is in Local time. You must first convert that Local date/time to Zulu date/time, then enter the converted Zulu Date. Once Personnel or Training updates have been imported via ARMS Web Services, these fields default to the Zulu date of the squadron's last successful Web Services import for that data type. You may change it to a date before the default but NOT after. Because ARMS gets a MILPDS update daily, Personnel records are updated in ARMS daily. Therefore all Personnel records will import with every Web Services Personnel and Training import. For squadrons importing via CSV files, the CSV Imports window will open. For each squadron, browse to the CSV file location and select the file. Click Import. View the import Log Files: Select a Start Date and End Date. Click Go. Click on the file name and a window will open with the log file details. To view a list of old log files, select a Start Date and End Date and click Go. The log lists: The Zulu date/time of the last ARMS data update, of the data imported into PEX The Zulu date/time the import was initiated, and by whom. A list of all persons whose data was imported. Each person listed will show the number of training events inserted/updated, the number of training events not inserted/updated and the training events not inserted/updated. If nothing is listed under a person, all training for that person imported successfully. A list of any errors. NOTES: ARMS Web Services does not provide the data necessary to determine the training event type (OTO, etc). For that reason PEX cannot guarantee the accuracy of the training events created during the import. For each inserted training event, the training event type can be verified in Continuation Training. You can import data from multiple ARMS units (for example from a student squadron) into a single PEX squadron. The import phase of the scheduled activity does not initiate until after the entire export has been received and acknowledged by ARMS, as the unit SARMs need to know that everything they sent from PEX was received and processed by ARMS before PEX begins taking an export from ARMS. This ensures that PEX and ARMS data for each person is always in synch/agreement. It's okay if the export is rejected or failed for a particular person, as the SARM gets a report in the PEX log listing which persons' exports failed. This allows the SARM to know why PEX shows one thing but ARMS shows another for an individual person.

Based on their flight, simulator, and training task accomplishments, PEX will calculate an Effective Mission Ready Status. For example, a person\u2019s assigned status may be CMR but due to a low sortie count, the effective status could be BM3. Once setup, the Effective Mission Ready Status is viewable on the Letter of X and the Go/No-Go pages in PEX. For each person using Ready Aircrew Program (RAP), first go to the Personnel module and set their mission ready status to CMR or BMC, and their experience indicator to E or I. RAP Requirements \u00b6 Navigate to Training > Continuation > Setup tab > RAP Requirements. Select a squadron. Select: ARMS to base your RAP calculation on ARMS RAP task identifiers. Unit Level to base your RAP calculation on Unit Level RAP task identifiers. Using Unit Level RAP will have no effect on RAP probation or Mission Readiness Status if your squadron has enabled Sortie RAP for MRS calculations. Neither to not preform RAP calculations. Select a data line by CP/MDS/Service Status. Enter your Task code (e.g., TOT RAP SRTY, SR001). ARMS: In the Task ID field, enter the Task ID as free-text. Unit Level: In the Unit Tasks field, click Choose, and select the appropriate task from the dropdown, and OK. From your RAP Tasking Message (RTM), enter your look back numbers for Total RAP, 3-Month, and 1-Month Look Back for that specific CP/MDS/Service Status combination for each of the BMC/CMR Experienced/Inexperienced categories. If the same RAP numbers apply to another CP/MDS/Service combination, copy it over: Select the data line with CP/MDS/Service Status you want to copy. Right-click and select Copy RAP Requirements or Unit Level Requirements. When the dialog opens, select the CP/MDS/Service you want to copy to by checking the left-hand box. Click OK.

Under the SIM Rules header, click the Select Task button to open the Select Task dialog. Type in or scroll to the task you use for SIM RAP and select it. Click OK. This will close the dialog and display the selected task to the left of the select task button. You\u2019ll also receive a message stating the same task wil be used for the other mission ready statuses for this squadron, MDS, crew position, service status combination. SIM Required wil be selected by default. If SIMs are optional and could be used to count toward your Flight RAP, select SIM Optional, skip step 8, and continue at step 9. If SIMs are required, enter the total SIMs per training cycle, 3-Month Look back (SIMs) and 1-Month Look back (SIMs) per your RTM. Required SIMs Under the required SIM RAP requirement numbers, there are five possible rules that may apply to your unit. If a rule applies, check the box to the left of the rule and enter the value for that rule. If you select the TDY Proration rule, you wil enter the personnel TDY days on the RAP O&M TDY page (described below). An explanation of each rule fol ows: Max number of excess RAP flights counted as SIMs for 1-month requirement. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP flights that can substitute for a RAP SIM, for the 1-month requirement. For example, a person has a one-month flight RAP requirement of 9 and a one-month SIM RAP requirement of 3. The rule is checked and a value of 1 flight has been entered. The person has accomplished 12 RAP flights and 1 RAP SIM. This person would not have met their one month SIM RAP requirements since only 1 actual RAP SIM was accomplished and only 1 of the excess 3 RAP flights could be counted as a SIM. Max number of excess RAP flights counted as SIMs for 3-month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP flights that can substitute for a RAP SIM, for 3-month look back. For example, a person has the following flight/SIM RAP requirements: one-month flight 9, three-month flight 27, one-month SIM 3, and three-month SIM 9. The rule is checked and a value of 4 is entered. The person has 12 flights one month and 30 for 3 months. The person has 2 SIMs for one month and 7 SIMs for three months. In this case, the person did not meet one-month SIM RAP requirements, but did make the three-month requirement because two excess RAP counting flights could be substituted for the 2 RAP SIMs the person was short for three month SIM look back. Max number of excess RAP SIMs that can be counted as flights for 1 month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP SIMs that can substitute for a RAP flight, for the 1-month requirement. Max number of excess RAP SIMs that can be counted as flights for 3 month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP SIMs that can substitute for a RAP flight, for 3-month look back. Minimum actual SIMs required per month. The entered value indicates the number of actual RAP SIMs that must be accomplished in a month to retain status. If this rule is used in conjunction with either of the rules above or the TDY Proration rule below, it takes precedence. For example, the one-month rule and this rule have been selected with values of 3 and 1 respectively. The SIM RAP 1 month requirement is 3. The person has 3 excess RAP flights, but no RAP SIMs. This person would not make RAP requirements because they didn\u2019t get at least 1 actual RAP SIM, even though they had enough excess RAP flights to otherwise meet the requirements for 1 month. TDY Proration. For each month: #X O&M days TDY reduces the SIM requirement by #X for that month. This rule allows you to prorate RAP SIMs for O&M days spent TDY. Proration can be down to 0, but the previous rule still takes precedence, so even if you prorate to 0, if you have a requirement to have at least 1 in a month and the person does not get it, they don\u2019t meet the RAP requirement. The O&M TDY days are entered for each individual on the RAP O&M TDY page and are entered by month. For example, the rule is selected and the values indicate 3 O&M TDY days reduce the SIM requirement by 1 for the month. SIM RAP requirement for the month is 3. The person had 5 days of O&M TDY. The person also accomplished 1 RAP SIM. This person would not make their one-month requirement since the rule would credit them only 1 SIM. If the person had 6 O&M TDY days, they would have made their one-month requirement since the rule would credit 2 RAP SIMs. Min number of SIMs required in one month to regain Msn Rdy Status. This rule is based on the person being in a non-mission ready status and needs to accomplish a set number of actual RAP SIMs to regain status, in addition to the look back numbers. This rule takes precedence over the one and three-month rules. For example, the rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. The one-month requirement is 3 RAP SIMs and 9 RAP flights. The person was non-mission ready. The one month rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. The person has accomplished 12 RAP flights and 1 RAP SIM. The person is still non-mission ready. Even though they met their flight RAP numbers and the first rule all ows them to meet their SIM RAP numbers, the person didn\u2019t get the two actual RAP SIMs that were required to regain status. !!! Note Whenever you change these optional check boxes, click save to ensure your PEX is updated. Optional SIMs Under the optional SIM RAP requirement numbers, there are two possible rules that may apply to your unit. If a rule applies, check the box to the left of the rule and enter the value for that rule. An explanation of each rule follows: Max number of SIMs per training cycle that can be counted as RAP Flight look back. This could be read as \u201cHow many of the first RAP SIMs in the training cycle can count towards using the rule below - counting RAP SIMs for flights by month.\u201d In other words, once the person accomplishes this many RAP SIMs, no matter when in the training cycle, subsequent RAP SIMs can no longer count towards flights. For example, this training cycle rule is checked with a value of 8. The monthly rule below is also checked with a value of RAP flight requirements are 9 flights per month and 27 flights for three-month look back. First Month \u2013 The person gets 9 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. The person makes RAP with their flights alone. However, two RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum, even though they weren\u2019t required to make RAP. Second Month - The person gets 7 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. The person made RAP based on the combination of RAP flights and RAP SIMs. Whether they were used to make RAP or not, two more RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum. He is up to 4 of the 8. Third Month - The person gets 6 RAP flights and 3 RAP SIMs. The person did not make RAP. Even though they had a combination that equaled 9, because only 2 of the 3 RAP SIMs count using the rule below. Whether they were used to make RAP or not, three more RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum. He is up to 7 of the 8. Fourth Month - The person gets 7 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. As soon as he did the first RAP SIM this month, that hits the 8 maximum. The person did not make RAP. Even though the rule below says two SIMs could be used monthly, the training cycle rule takes precedence and only 1 SIM could count. Subsequent Months \u2013 No more RAP SIMs could count towards the monthly requirement because the person already hit the 8 maximum. The worst case scenario is the person accomplishing all 8 RAP SIMs the first month of the training cycle and not using any towards RAP flights. Since the maximum of 8 were accomplished, no subsequent RAP SIMs in the entire training cycle could be used to count towards meeting future monthly RAP flight requirements. Max number of SIMs per month that can be counted as RAP Flight look back. Enter the maximum number of RAP SIMs per month that can be counted toward flight RAP. For example, the rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. Person is required 9 flights for one-month RAP requirement. The person accomplished 7 RAP flights and 3 RAP SIMs. The person would make their one-month flight RAP requirement because 2 of the SIMs would count toward the 2 flights the person was short. !!!

ARMS- Configure your PEX-ARMS Interface \u00b6 The ARMS tab is used to setup the PEX interface with ARMS, import ARMS tasks and export ARMS tasks. ARMS 6.2 delivered a Jaspersoft reports interface. There are two interface functions that PEX - ARMs customers perform in PEX. Specifically: Import data from ARMS to PEX PEX no longer provides the Oracle Discover (.dis) files required to create the three .csv files. Instead, we wil generate Jaspersoft Ad Hoc Views/Reports. These Ad Hoc Views/Reports take the place of the .dis files. These Adhoc View/Reports will be in Jaspersoft and accessible to all ARMS users worldwide. Users will access these reports to generate the three.csv files: Personnel, Training, and 7-30-60-90 Personnel Flight Hours. Users must schedule the reports in ARMS. Export data from PEX to ARMS There is no change. Users still need to install the ODAC (Oracle Data Access Components) in order to push data out of PEX to ARMS. Settings Associate PEX Squadrons to ARMS Unit Identifiers Select a squadron. In the Add ARMS unit to import into selected PEX squadron text box: Type in (or paste) the 17-character ARMS Unit Identifier (looks like: 0203ARSSQ00000000) and click Add. This identifier can be found on the Personnel.CSV file in cell A2. Type in (or paste) the 9-character ARMS Unit Identifier (looks like: 0203ARSSQ) and click Add. This identifier can be found on the 7/30/60/90.CSV file. !!! NOTE * You can import data from multiple ARMS units (for example from a student squadron) into a single PEX squadron. * To disassociate an ARMS unit, select the unit and click Remove. Enter AFTO 781 Data Select a squadron In the 781 Data > HARM Code text box, type in your HARM Code (can be found on existing AFTO 781s). Fill out the remaining three text boxes with 781 Data (these can also be found on existing 781s). Click Save. Exclude PEX-generated training tasks during ARMS Imports PEX generates training tasks for four ARMS training requirements that aren\u2019t tracked by ARMS as training events: Physical Exam, Altitude Chamber, Records Review, and ASC Termination Date. If your unit does not use one or more of these (for example, an ICBM unit that does not require periodic Altitude Chamber training), check the box by that item(s) to exclude PEX from generating it during the ARMS import and click Save. .CSV File Locations (WinPEX only) Browse to the path where the .CSV file and click save. Import Select the squadron(s). Select the type of data (Personnel, Training, and/or 7/30/60/90 Flying Hours) to import. Click Import. To view the import log files: Select a Start Date and End Date.

If it applies to multiple MDS\u2019s in your squadron, select all . CP: Select the CP to associate the task to. If it applies to multiple CP\u2019s in your squadron, select All. !!! NOTE Associating tasks to a MDS/CP impact the following areas/functions: Include in Check Assigned and the Training Go No-Go ball for No-Go tasks. Type: The four types are Currency, Proficiency, Currency/Proficiency, or One-Time. Currency tasks must be done at regular intervals defined by the task, e.g., once every 30 days. Proficiency tasks must be done a certain number of times within a training cycle, e.g., 10 times between 1 January 16 and 31 December 16. The No-Go checkbox is disabled for proficiency tasks because they do not have due dates. Currency/Proficiency tasks have a number that must be done by the end of the training cycle and also must be completed within periodic intervals. One-Time tasks must be done once, ever. Currency and Currency/Proficiency Tasks require a Frequency and Number, how often the task must be done: Days: The task is due in a specified number of days. Weekly. The task is due in a specified number of weeks, at the end of the week. Months: The task is due in a specified number of months, on the same numbered day it was accomplished. Monthly: The task is due in a specified number of months, at the end of the month. Quarterly: The task is due in a specified number of quarters, at the end of the quarter. Quarters are Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, and Oct- De3. Semi-Annually: The task is due in a specified number of halves, at the end of the half. Halves are Jan-Jun and Jul-De3. Years: The task is due in a specified number of years, on the same date it was accomplished. Annually (CY): The task is due in a specified number of years, at the end of the calendar year, 31 December. Annually (FY): The task is due in a specified number of years, at the end of the fiscal year, 30 September. Birth Month: The task is due annually on the last day of the birth month. Training Cycle: The task is due by the end of the training cycle. Freq #. Some frequency types (Days, Months, Monthly, Years, Annually (CY) and Annually (FY)) require you enter a number too. In other words, how many days, months, or years. E.g., a Years task with a Freq # of 5, means it must be done every five years. A task accomplished on 3 Jan 2016 would be due on 3 Jan 2021. A Weekly frequency requires a day of the week be specified and Birth Month all ows you to specify additional months beyond the Birth Month. Prof #: The number of times the task must be accomplished during the training cycle. It is required only for Proficiency and Currency/Proficiency tasks. Currency Warning Days. Specifying warning days allows you to identify, by task, when you want tasks to be highlighted when they are approaching overdue status. Long warning wil highlight a task in Yellow. Short warning will highlight a task in Pink. E.g., you enter 30 days for Long warning and 5 days for short warning; when the task is within 30 days of going overdue, it will go yellow; when within 5 days, Pink. Tasks will always go red when actually overdue. Defaults to 60 days and 30 days respectively. Program Code: Examples are PF, PT, et3. You can use unit program codes, similar to ARMS program codes, to filter unit tasks. You can assign multiple program codes to the same task. If the task is to be mapped to an ADLS task, it must have a program code of ADLS. Active: Used to turn on the task. Inactive tasks wil be hidden throughout the rest of PEX. No-Go: No-Go is locally-determined. Marking a task as No-Go will turn a person's Training No-Go indicator red when the task is overdue. No-Go tasks are usually reserved for tasks that prevent a person from accomplishing duty, even with supervision, tasks such as Flight Physical or Altitude Chamber. No-Go tasks should not be dual categorized as Priority 1. Auditing Required: When selected, the task will not update the person's training records until approved by the auditor. If not selected, as soon as the person reports accomplishment of the task, the task is considered done, without any supervisory auditing, and the person's training records are updated. Enable Manual Override: When checked, these tasks can be reported (logged) from the Go/No-Go page by someone with appropriate supervisor permissions but will show as overwritten (\u201cdoughnut\u201d indicator) until properly reported. Affects BMC: This checkbox does nothing. It is planned for future use. Affects CMR: This task, if overdue, will affect the person's Combat Mission Ready status and is used on the Check Schedule Report. Include in Check Assigned: when checked, PEX will check to see if all personnel with the same MDS and CP as the tasks and a \u201cqualified\u201d qualification code are assigned this task. Remarks: Free text up to 255 characters that will show up in the Remarks column of My Page and as a link on the TAR to help personnel fil out the worksheet correctly. An example remark would be, \u201cLog no more than two per sortie.\u201d Right-click on the task, select Edit and, when the dialog opens, enter a remark in the Remarks field and click Save. Remarks also appear on the Audit > TAR > TARs page. Edit HQ CT Task and Local Tasks Units can only edit the following settings for HQ CT tasks: Task group, MDS/CP, Currency warning days, active status, Include in Check Assigned, and Remarks.

The ARMS Bypass feature allows PEX users to ignore or bypass ARMS Training Task dates, on the occasion ARMS is down. With the bypass on, PEX will temporarily calculate training due dates within PEX. Setting the Bypass to \"On\" will allow the unit to bypass ARMS currency and/or currency/proficiency type training events. It has no effect on proficiency and one-time tasks. Bypass means the unit will use PEX to manually calculate due dates for specific training events based off of a person's last recorded accomplished date. Setting the Bypass to \"Off\" with no ARMS training file import, means accomplished and due dates in PEX will not be updated until the next ARMS file import, even when logged and audited. Roles: Training/Auditor ARMS and Squadron Administrator can turn this feature on or off. All other roles will be able to see banners throughout PEX in those areas where ARMS Training Events are displayed. !!! CAUTION The Bypass feature is a back-up for the selected squadron when ARMS is down. It all ows users to overwrite Currency training event dates until ARMS is back online. Users must have source documents for overwriting dates. Bypass is turned off when an ARMS import is done and/or a user turns it off. ARMS is the true source for all training information; PEX is not a replacement system. Set the ARMS Bypass to On. Go to Training > Continuation > Setup > ARMS Tasks > Squadron. The ARMS Bypass control and status indicator is located at top right. Click On, and the ARMS Bypass dialog opens. Set bypass frequency days for individual training tasks. Select the Bypass ARMS radio button. Click Save, the dialog closes, and you are returned to the ARMS Tasks page. Go to the new Bypass Frequency Number in Days column. For each task, set the number of days desired. Set bypass frequency days for all training tasks. Select the Bypass and set Frequency Number in Days for all assigned Currency Tasks radio button. Set Frequency Number in Days as desired. Click Save, the dialog closes, and you are returned to the ARMS Tasks page. Go to the new Bypass Frequency Number in Days column. For all tasks, note the number of days set as entered in the previous step. Set the ARMS Bypass to Off. Go to Training > Continuation > Setup > ARMS Tasks > Squadron. The ARMS Bypass control and status indicator is located at top right. Click Off. Still on the ARMS Tasks page, go to the new Bypass Frequency Number in Days column. Note that the number of days previously set remains. On the next ARMS import, these wil reset to the data in ARMS. Bypass indicators. With the Bypass set to On: In Ops > Go/NoGo > TNG, an \u201cA\u201d is superimposed on the training bal s. A yellow ARMS is Bypassed for the Selected Squadron banner appears in: Displays > My Page Ops > Squadron Daily Schedule Training > Continuation Flying Schedule > Crew Tab Training > Qualification > Folder, Cont Training tab > Continuation Training Tasks Notes: Once the Bypass is turned on and the frequency days are set for the Training Tasks, an immediate calculation takes place. Training Tasks that are marked Priority 1 or No-Go are also included if selected for bypass. Any training events marked as \"Manual Override\" will not be considered for Bypass. Reported Training Tasks must belong to the Current Training Cycle, audited and approved in PEX, in order for the Bypass to calculate the due date. The Bypass will use the latest approved last accomplished date to calculate a new last accomplished date and due date. The Bypass feature is turned \"Off\", when any ARMS .csv import is done in PEX (Personnel, Training, and or 7/30/60/90 day). The Bypass feature can also be turned off, by simply setting the squadron's ARMS Bypass \"Off\". The frequency number of days to calculate Bypass due dates can be set from 0 to 2000 days. Training events set with a frequency of \"0\" are not calculated. The ARMS Bypass feature effects multiple locations in PEX. Users are presented with banners in areas that display ARMS Training Events for a Person. Reporting Completed Training Tasks (TAR) \u00b6 Reporting tab There are several ways to report training accomplished in PEX. Below is a description of the different ways and recommendation on when to use each for reporting training accomplished. Flight Training from Squadron Daily Schedule: The best way for a person to report flight training is from the Squadron Daily Schedule page. The best practice is to setup this page in auto-refresh mode at Maintenance Debrief and/or the Ops Desk. In the Sortie grid, ensure the TAR column is selected for display. This will show a list of all the people on the sortie. When they get back from a flight, they click on their name, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks. Flight Training from My Page \u2013 TAR link: From My Page, in the top commitments section, the sortie will be listed, along with a TAR hyperlink. They can click on the TAR link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks. Ground Training (Scheduled) from My Page \u2013 TAR link: From My Page, in the top commitments section, the ground training will be listed, along with a TAR hyperlink. They can click on the TAR link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks. Ground Training (Unscheduled) from My Page \u2013 TAR (Non MSN) link: From My Page, in the top-right area, just below the TEST tab, click on the TAR (Non MSN) link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks. Report Training for other people or multiple personnel at one time from CT Module \u2013 Reporting tab: Report training for multiple personnel where many of them logged the same tasks. You can report on one person, then use the Apply to all Remaining to copy the same accomplishments to the remaining crew members. NOTES: If a training task does not require auditing, when the Save/Next feature is used, the next record will appear not editable (it is automatically \"approved\" since no audit is required). If the next person needs to make a change from what was saved, a user with administrator permissions can right-click, and in the context menu select Unapprove & Clear Accomplishment, and enter the required dat1. If a group is reporting training using the Save/Next feature, and an individual needs to add a training task to their TAR right-click, and in the context menu select Additional Instance to add the required dat1. Report by Person \u00b6 Click the Person link at the top of the page. Select a reporting worksheet from the Worksheets grid on the top left of the page. Check the box next to at least one name from the Personnel grid. Click Generate TAR. This will open a working copy of a report. Enter the number of times you completed each task in the Accomplished Volume field and when the task was accomplished in the Date Accomplished fields. The accomplished date wil default to the current date when reporting by person but can be changed by clicking in the Date Accomplished field. Depending on the worksheet, there may be additional activated columns for Time, Method, Scheduled Volume, Loss Reason, Score, Weapons Attempts and Weapons Hits. If these columns apply, enter the pertinent dat1. Select to either Save/Next, Apply to all Remaining, Delete all , or Delete. To report the same task completed on more than one date: Enter the Accomplished Volume for the task, enter the date accomplished, right-click on the task and select Additional Instance. Enter the information for the task and click save. This feature adds another instance of the same task to the TAR with a different date. The Save/Next button saves the current log entry. If you selected multiple people from the Personnel list, the Save/Next button takes you to the TAR for the next person in line. To report training tasks quickly when the number accomplished and date accomplished is the same for all personnel: select multiple people from the Personnel grid, update the accomplished volume and date for each task on the first TAR, and click Apply to All Remaining. This updates each TAR with the same accomplished volume and date for each task. When you select Save/Next, if you input an event date outside of your training cycle or if the person was not assigned that task, PEX will generate a descriptive error. If a task is assigned to a person that line of the report will be white (editable) for the Accomplished Volume and Accomplished Date blocks. If the task is not assigned to the individual, that line of the report will be a light gray (read only). The Delete and Delete all buttons delete the person\u2019s training report worksheet(s) that you are working on at that time. Report by Mission \u00b6 Select the Start and End dates to get a list of missions between those dates and click GO. Select the mission to generate a list of personnel on that sortie and a list of available reporting worksheets. Select from each list and click Generate TAR. Select the Actual Sortie Type in the TAR header if required. The rest of this tab functions the same as the Person tab. Select the Fuel Consumption button to open the Fuel Data section: Enter the fuel information for the sortie and PEX will calculate the Total Fuel Used, Total Fuel Burned, and Burn Rate. Enter any comments about the fuel usage on the sortie and whether the sortie was effective or not. Capture any pertinent information about your receivers or tankers in the Your Receiver Data and Your Tanker Data sections. Once entered, the data can be viewed at Scheduling > Reports > Fuel Report. Report by Commitment \u00b6 Select the Start and End dates to get a list of commitments between those dates. Select the commitment to generate a list of personnel on that commitment and a list of available reporting worksheets. Select from each list and click Generate TAR. The rest of this tab functions the same as the Person tab. Generate AF 1522 (Group Report) \u00b6 Use this function if multiple people are reporting the same task. A dialog box will open that allows you to insert (optional) the Instructor\u2019s name onto the AF Form 1522 (access from the Menu under Training, Reports). Log the task number and dates and select the Apply to all Remaining button. Overview The Overview sub tab shows all completed reports in the queue for auditing. TTP: Right Click in the Submitted TARs grid to find TARs with No Accomplishments Logged, or Crew members without TARs.

This upgrade training can take the form of short in-unit upgrades and formal schoolhouse upgrades. Before you can utilize Mission training, you must configure several Setup features to your unit\u2019s specifications. This includes adding Grade Sets, creating Training Tasks that wil be used for your courses, and setting the number of monthly and quarterly reviews for student\u2019s Grade Folders. Controls Access this module by navigating to Main Menu > Training > Mission. Workspace Setup Mission Training Select the Setup Tab in the QT module. Add a Grade Set A grade set is all the different grades you will use when evaluating student tasks and Blocks of Instruction (BOI). Each MAJCOM uses different grades. A Grade Set is where you tell PEX which grades you are going to use. Training > Mission > Setup > Course Grade Sets. Select the squadron from the dropdown menu. Right-Click in the Course Grade Sets Canvas and select Add. Create a Grade Set Name and click on the Canvas to save. Decide whether your MAJCOM/Unit utilizes: 1) Task Grades and BOI Grades or 2) Task Proficiency Levels, Task Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades. !!! NOTE All Grade Sets require BOI grades. You wil need to know this information in order to decide which Gradesheet form you should select when you are ready to create your course. Selecting the correct Gradesheet form that corresponds to your Grade Set will allow your grades to automatically populate to your chosen form once grading is complete. See Help Topic, QT - Create Courses for selecting the appropriate Gradesheet forms. Add grades to the appropriate panel by right-clicking in the specific grid you would like to use. Assign grades/levels with the appropriate ranking (1 is the highest). It is imperative you assign the appropriate ranking to all grades/levels in order for the grading feature to work properly in PEX. Task Grade. These are the grades students can achieve on a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. Task Proficiency Level. Displays the grades student can achieve when they demonstrate/perform a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. Task Knowledge Level. Displays the grades student can achieve when they describe/explain a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. BOI Grade. The grades students can achieve after completing a Block of Instruction. This field is required for all courses. Select the checkbox for the default grade/level for each panel, if desired. The default grade/level will automatically populate minimum grades for all BOIs and tasks built in the course. PEX will classify any grades above the minimum as satisfying requirements and any grade below the minimum as failing. If you would like to change the default minimum grade for specific BOIs or tasks, you can make this adjustment in the Course Build on the desired BOI(s) and task(s). See Help Topic, QT - Building Courses. Other options from this screen include the ability to send a Grade Set to another squadron (Send To), delete, print, and export Grades, Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels and/or BOI Grades to Excel by right-clicking a specific Grade Set. !!! NOTE Once a Grade Set is assigned to a course, you cannot make any revisions to that specific Grade Set. If you need to make revisions to a Grade Set that is being used, create a new Grade Set with a different name. Apply the new Grade Set to your desired course while you are on the Courses page. Delete the older/inaccurate Grade Set. Applying a new Grade Set for a course that has already been built will delete all minimum required Task Grades, Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades. You will need to input this information manually into the course BOIs. See Help Topics, QT - Create Courses. Add a Task List \u00b6 Tasks are the graded items in a BOI. For example, a simulator training event would have numerous tasks, such as \u201cPre-mission Briefing.\u201d This is where you enter all your tasks for all your courses. Adding a master task list before beginning your course build will keep you from duplicating dat1. A master task list will also help you maintain standardization between courses. Training > Mission > Setup > Course Tasks. Select the squadron from the dropdown menu. Select Course Tasks. Right-Click in the Course Tasks Canvas and select Add. Give the task a unique identifier for the Task Code. Using the same identifier with a different number for all the tasks listed in that course will allow you to easily search for Task Codes during course builds. Be sure to maintain consistency with your naming scheme. For example, \u201cB-52 EW UPG-01\u201d and \u201cB-52 EW UPG-02\u201d. Other options available from this screen include the ability to send tasks to another squadron (Send To), delete a task, export tasks to Excel, and printing tasks by right-clicking on selected tasks. !!! NOTE You can add additional tasks to your master task list. However, if a task has been applied to a course via a BOI, you cannot edit or delete this task from the master Task List until it has been removed from all BOIs. Set Review Options \u00b6 Configuring Review Options allows you to select who can review/certify student folders and how often the reviews are required. Training > Mission > Setup > Options. Select the squadron from the dropdown menu. You may enter a name for the unit defined tab of the training folder. The default name is 623. Select the desired number of monthly folder reviews (0-2). Select the desired number of quarterly folder reviews (0-2). Select whether or not you will allow a supervisor to complete a folder review. !!! NOTE If you cannot \"see\" the Supervisor Review option, Click on the Number of Reviewers and hit the TAB key until the option is displayed. Select the method to populate BOI Reviewer/Certifying information: Logged in User. Automatically populates the unit/name information in the BOI grade sheet with that of the logged-in user. Reviewers cannot be logged into a group account or as PEXAdmin. Reviewers must be logged in as a user. Also select whether or not a Supervisor can Review/Certify. Selectable List. Allows you to specify unit, then name, of any member in the database. If a student does not meet the minimum requirements for a BOI, select which tasks the student should repeat. All Tasks. All tasks from the original BOI will be included in the repeat BOI. Failed/Incomplete Tasks. Only the failed/Incomplete tasks from the original BOI will be included in the repeat BOI. !!! NOTE The Review Options will be applied to all courses in your selected squadron. Review Options are not course specific. Add Gradesheet Reminders \u00b6 Gradesheet reminders trigger warnings when Task or BOI grades are graded below minimum. Training > Mission > Setup > Options Select the squadron Under Gradesheet Reminders, pick which grades you want warnings for: Task Grade, Task Proficiency Level, Task Minimum Knowledge Level, and/or Overall BOI Grade. Create links between BOIs and STS Task lists \u00b6 Creating links between BOIs and STS task list provides valuable information to trainers and supervisors. Once the link is established, training on a particular BOI will now have a corresponding STS tied to it and show which STS items are ready to be signed by the trainee. !!! NOTE This feature DOES NOT automatically sign off items. Use the Popular Topics FAQ's to retrieve items that need to be signed off. Training > Mission > Setup > Link QT BOIs to STS Tasks. Select the Squadron, the Task List and Skill Level. Select Add, and the Task List builds on the left. Under BOIs, select the Course you are going to associate the Task list items to. Check the Line Item number(s) from the left and then the BOI name(s) from the right and click Save. Edit existing links between BOIs and STS Task lists \u00b6 If you need to modify a link, select one group of Task List Tasks and click Edit. In the resulting Task List Details and BOIs lists, make the appropriate changes and click Save. Add Phases \u00b6 Phases can be created to organize your course into distinct sections which define various portions of your course. End of Phase can also be defined in the course to determine if specific event(s) requirements have been met Go to Mission Training Homepage > Setup > Phase Builder > select Squadron > Course name Course must be a New Course Click add Phase or right click in white space Name Phase and select symbol, edit or remove by selecting Phase and right clicking or select Phase and delete Under Setup > Course Builder > select Course > open each BOI Details and assign the correct Phase, if the BOI is the last in that Phase designate it as End of Phase in the BOI Create Phase Requirements under Overview: Quantity: Calculated vs. Required fields Calculated field is the total number of times that a particular task is expected to be completed according to the Number Required for that one task across all BOIs in the course. Example: If there are 3 BOIs in the phase, and all 3 include the Task \u201cNight Landing\u201d with a Required number of 1 each time, then the Quantity > Calculated field will show 3. Required field is the total number of times a student is required to complete that task during that entire phase. Grade: Calculated vs. Required Fields (Parallel requirements and definitions as for the Quantity fields) Calculated field is the highest required Min Grade that a particular task is set for across all BOIs in the phase. Required field is the Min Grade that a student is required to achieve by the End of Phase (the last BOI in that phase). Activate Course Create a Course \u00b6 A Course is a sequence of individual training events. These training events are grouped into Blocks of Instruction (BOIs). The BOIs contain individual training tasks. This topic explains how to create the course properties, after which you build the course itself, with BOIs and tasks. !!! NOTE Before building a course, contact the PEX Help Desk. Often, we can build the course for you. If you want to build the course on your own, first review the help topic, Build a Course.

Only Administrators and Training Administrators can change names that populate in the dropdowns, but Trainers and Certifying Officials can select names within the dropdowns to assign to each task. Press Save once the Trainer, Certifying Official, Start and Completion Dates are selected. If a task only has a Completed Date (no Start Date), the Certifying Official is the only person who can sign the task. The tasks can now be signed. Either the Trainer or the Certifying Official can be the first to sign, but not the Trainee. The Trainer cannot sign after the Certifying Official signs. Signing is accomplished by clicking the Sign button to the right of the person signing.

It then becomes necessary to transcribe the accomplished tasks from the Old Version Task List to the New Version for the Trainees. This transcription can now be done in PEX. The transcription is a two-step process. The first step is to transcribe the Trainees in Qualification Training. This step can only be accomplished by Administrators and Training Administrators. The second step is to validate the transcription. Transcribe a task list As an Administrator or Training Administrator, go to Qualification Training. Supervisor and Training Administrators must Validate the Transcription before the Trainee\u2019s Training Folder before it will transcribe fully. Menu > Training > Qualification > Person Assignments > By Trainee Transcription Select the appropriate Squadron in the Squadron dropdown. Select the appropriate Task List in the Task List dropdown. Select the appropriate Skill Level in the Skill Level dropdown. A list of all the assigned Trainees to the Squadron, Task List, and Skill Level will appear in the Available Trainee box. Select the names you would like to Transcribe. Select the New Version of the Task List and Workcenter at the bottom of the page. Select the Transcribe Trainees button. A dialog will appear telling you the Transcription is complete, but it still needs to be validated in the Training Folder. Validate a Transcription Validating the transcription finalizes the process. This allows you to verify that all items selected for transcription are applied correctly and if not, to make the necessary changes or cancel the transcription by deleting the new Task List from the Training Folder. Menu > Training > Qualification > Overview > Folder Reviews As an Administrator, Training Administrator or Supervisor of the Trainee open the Training Folder and click on the 623 tab. Both the old and new versions of the Task List will appear in the training grid on the top left side of the folder. Select each version of the Task List and verify the correct data has been transcribed. Both Task Lists are read only until the transcription is validated or the new Task List is deleted. When you have verified that all data is correct, select the new version of the Task List and click the Validate Transcription button. This completes the process by leaving the Old Version of the Task List in a read only state (exception: you can still add a Completed Date to the Task List) and making the New Version active for use. The Old Version of the Task List can be deleted from the Training Folder once the validation is completed. We strongly recommend printing a hard copy of the Old Version of Task List before deletion. Once validated, the transcription can only be reversed by deleting the new Task List in the Training Folder. If the new Task List is deleted, the previous one is reactivated. The Transcription to the New Version of the Task List wil be documented in Additional documentation. 623a Miscellaneous \u00b6 Print a 623a Training > Qualification > Setup > Task List Builder Task Lists can be printed in .PDF format by clicking the Additional Task List Actions button and selecting View/Print Task List from the menu.

PEX now includes connectivity to ARMS via Web Services. This allows users to easily exchange data between ARMS and PEX without using the process of importing data using ARMS-generated CSV files and exporting data using ODA3. This CSV/Virtual Account process remains in place, but has been updated. The ARMS tab is used to setup the PEX interface with ARMS to send data from ARMS to PEX, and PEX to ARMS. There are two interface functions. Send validated personnel, personnel flying hours, and training data from ARMS to PEX. Send audited training accomplishments and AFTO 781 data from PEX to ARMS. There are two interface methods. CSV/Virtual Account. This is the legacy method used in previous versions of PEX. CSV. Export data from ARMS into a CSV file, then manually import the file into PEX.

Web Service imports require the Zulu Dates of the last successful imports of Personnel and Training records. ARMS Web Services only import Personnel and Training records which have been changed in ARMS since the Zulu date specified in the Web Service Imports dialog. Blank dates indicate the squadron has not yet completed a Web Services import for that data type (Personnel or Training). To ensure a squadron's first web service import includes all records changed in ARMS since the squadron's last CSV import, refer to the log file for the squadron's last successful CSV import for each data type. At the top of each log file locate the \"Data Downloaded from ARMS\" date. This is the date/time of the last ARMS import. If the last import was completed in PEX v5.16.1 or later, the date/time is in Zulu. You can enter that date as it is. If the last import was completed in PEX v5.16.0 or earlier, the date/time is in Local time. You must first convert that Local date/time to Zulu date/time, then enter the converted Zulu Date. Once Personnel or Training updates have been imported via ARMS Web Services, these fields default to the Zulu date of the squadron's last successful Web Services import for that data type. You may change it to a date before the default but NOT after. Because ARMS gets a MILPDS update daily, Personnel records are updated in ARMS daily.

Each person listed will show the number of training events inserted/updated, the number of training events not inserted/updated and the training events not inserted/updated. If nothing is listed under a person, all training for that person imported successfully. A list of any errors. NOTES: ARMS Web Services does not provide the data necessary to determine the training event type (OTO, etc). For that reason PEX cannot guarantee the accuracy of the training events created during the import. For each inserted training event, the training event type can be verified in Continuation Training. You can import data from multiple ARMS units (for example from a student squadron) into a single PEX squadron. The import phase of the scheduled activity does not initiate until after the entire export has been received and acknowledged by ARMS, as the unit SARMs need to know that everything they sent from PEX was received and processed by ARMS before PEX begins taking an export from ARMS. This ensures that PEX and ARMS data for each person is always in synch/agreement. It's okay if the export is rejected or failed for a particular person, as the SARM gets a report in the PEX log listing which persons' exports failed.

If SIMs are required, enter the total SIMs per training cycle, 3-Month Look back (SIMs) and 1-Month Look back (SIMs) per your RTM.

If you select the TDY Proration rule, you wil enter the personnel TDY days on the RAP O&M TDY page (described below). An explanation of each rule fol ows: Max number of excess RAP flights counted as SIMs for 1-month requirement. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP flights that can substitute for a RAP SIM, for the 1-month requirement. For example, a person has a one-month flight RAP requirement of 9 and a one-month SIM RAP requirement of 3. The rule is checked and a value of 1 flight has been entered. The person has accomplished 12 RAP flights and 1 RAP SIM. This person would not have met their one month SIM RAP requirements since only 1 actual RAP SIM was accomplished and only 1 of the excess 3 RAP flights could be counted as a SIM. Max number of excess RAP flights counted as SIMs for 3-month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP flights that can substitute for a RAP SIM, for 3-month look back. For example, a person has the following flight/SIM RAP requirements: one-month flight 9, three-month flight 27, one-month SIM 3, and three-month SIM 9. The rule is checked and a value of 4 is entered. The person has 12 flights one month and 30 for 3 months. The person has 2 SIMs for one month and 7 SIMs for three months. In this case, the person did not meet one-month SIM RAP requirements, but did make the three-month requirement because two excess RAP counting flights could be substituted for the 2 RAP SIMs the person was short for three month SIM look back. Max number of excess RAP SIMs that can be counted as flights for 1 month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP SIMs that can substitute for a RAP flight, for the 1-month requirement. Max number of excess RAP SIMs that can be counted as flights for 3 month look back. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP SIMs that can substitute for a RAP flight, for 3-month look back. Minimum actual SIMs required per month. The entered value indicates the number of actual RAP SIMs that must be accomplished in a month to retain status. If this rule is used in conjunction with either of the rules above or the TDY Proration rule below, it takes precedence. For example, the one-month rule and this rule have been selected with values of 3 and 1 respectively. The SIM RAP 1 month requirement is 3. The person has 3 excess RAP flights, but no RAP SIMs. This person would not make RAP requirements because they didn\u2019t get at least 1 actual RAP SIM, even though they had enough excess RAP flights to otherwise meet the requirements for 1 month. TDY Proration. For each month: #X O&M days TDY reduces the SIM requirement by #X for that month. This rule allows you to prorate RAP SIMs for O&M days spent TDY. Proration can be down to 0, but the previous rule still takes precedence, so even if you prorate to 0, if you have a requirement to have at least 1 in a month and the person does not get it, they don\u2019t meet the RAP requirement. The O&M TDY days are entered for each individual on the RAP O&M TDY page and are entered by month. For example, the rule is selected and the values indicate 3 O&M TDY days reduce the SIM requirement by 1 for the month. SIM RAP requirement for the month is 3. The person had 5 days of O&M TDY. The person also accomplished 1 RAP SIM. This person would not make their one-month requirement since the rule would credit them only 1 SIM. If the person had 6 O&M TDY days, they would have made their one-month requirement since the rule would credit 2 RAP SIMs. Min number of SIMs required in one month to regain Msn Rdy Status. This rule is based on the person being in a non-mission ready status and needs to accomplish a set number of actual RAP SIMs to regain status, in addition to the look back numbers. This rule takes precedence over the one and three-month rules. For example, the rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. The one-month requirement is 3 RAP SIMs and 9 RAP flights. The person was non-mission ready. The one month rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. The person has accomplished 12 RAP flights and 1 RAP SIM. The person is still non-mission ready. Even though they met their flight RAP numbers and the first rule all ows them to meet their SIM RAP numbers, the person didn\u2019t get the two actual RAP SIMs that were required to regain status. !!! Note Whenever you change these optional check boxes, click save to ensure your PEX is updated. Optional SIMs Under the optional SIM RAP requirement numbers, there are two possible rules that may apply to your unit. If a rule applies, check the box to the left of the rule and enter the value for that rule. An explanation of each rule follows: Max number of SIMs per training cycle that can be counted as RAP Flight look back. This could be read as \u201cHow many of the first RAP SIMs in the training cycle can count towards using the rule below - counting RAP SIMs for flights by month.\u201d In other words, once the person accomplishes this many RAP SIMs, no matter when in the training cycle, subsequent RAP SIMs can no longer count towards flights. For example, this training cycle rule is checked with a value of 8. The monthly rule below is also checked with a value of RAP flight requirements are 9 flights per month and 27 flights for three-month look back. First Month \u2013 The person gets 9 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. The person makes RAP with their flights alone. However, two RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum, even though they weren\u2019t required to make RAP. Second Month - The person gets 7 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. The person made RAP based on the combination of RAP flights and RAP SIMs. Whether they were used to make RAP or not, two more RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum. He is up to 4 of the 8. Third Month - The person gets 6 RAP flights and 3 RAP SIMs. The person did not make RAP. Even though they had a combination that equaled 9, because only 2 of the 3 RAP SIMs count using the rule below. Whether they were used to make RAP or not, three more RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum. He is up to 7 of the 8. Fourth Month - The person gets 7 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. As soon as he did the first RAP SIM this month, that hits the 8 maximum. The person did not make RAP. Even though the rule below says two SIMs could be used monthly, the training cycle rule takes precedence and only 1 SIM could count. Subsequent Months \u2013 No more RAP SIMs could count towards the monthly requirement because the person already hit the 8 maximum. The worst case scenario is the person accomplishing all 8 RAP SIMs the first month of the training cycle and not using any towards RAP flights. Since the maximum of 8 were accomplished, no subsequent RAP SIMs in the entire training cycle could be used to count towards meeting future monthly RAP flight requirements. Max number of SIMs per month that can be counted as RAP Flight look back. Enter the maximum number of RAP SIMs per month that can be counted toward flight RAP. For example, the rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. Person is required 9 flights for one-month RAP requirement. The person accomplished 7 RAP flights and 3 RAP SIMs. The person would make their one-month flight RAP requirement because 2 of the SIMs would count toward the 2 flights the person was short. !!!

NOTE Associating tasks to a MDS/CP impact the following areas/functions: Include in Check Assigned and the Training Go No-Go ball for No-Go tasks. Type: The four types are Currency, Proficiency, Currency/Proficiency, or One-Time. Currency tasks must be done at regular intervals defined by the task, e.g., once every 30 days. Proficiency tasks must be done a certain number of times within a training cycle, e.g., 10 times between 1 January 16 and 31 December 16. The No-Go checkbox is disabled for proficiency tasks because they do not have due dates. Currency/Proficiency tasks have a number that must be done by the end of the training cycle and also must be completed within periodic intervals. One-Time tasks must be done once, ever. Currency and Currency/Proficiency Tasks require a Frequency and Number, how often the task must be done: Days: The task is due in a specified number of days. Weekly. The task is due in a specified number of weeks, at the end of the week. Months: The task is due in a specified number of months, on the same numbered day it was accomplished. Monthly: The task is due in a specified number of months, at the end of the month. Quarterly: The task is due in a specified number of quarters, at the end of the quarter. Quarters are Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, and Oct- De3. Semi-Annually: The task is due in a specified number of halves, at the end of the half. Halves are Jan-Jun and Jul-De3. Years: The task is due in a specified number of years, on the same date it was accomplished. Annually (CY): The task is due in a specified number of years, at the end of the calendar year, 31 December. Annually (FY): The task is due in a specified number of years, at the end of the fiscal year, 30 September. Birth Month: The task is due annually on the last day of the birth month. Training Cycle: The task is due by the end of the training cycle. Freq #. Some frequency types (Days, Months, Monthly, Years, Annually (CY) and Annually (FY)) require you enter a number too. In other words, how many days, months, or years. E.g., a Years task with a Freq # of 5, means it must be done every five years. A task accomplished on 3 Jan 2016 would be due on 3 Jan 2021. A Weekly frequency requires a day of the week be specified and Birth Month all ows you to specify additional months beyond the Birth Month. Prof #: The number of times the task must be accomplished during the training cycle. It is required only for Proficiency and Currency/Proficiency tasks. Currency Warning Days. Specifying warning days allows you to identify, by task, when you want tasks to be highlighted when they are approaching overdue status. Long warning wil highlight a task in Yellow. Short warning will highlight a task in Pink. E.g., you enter 30 days for Long warning and 5 days for short warning; when the task is within 30 days of going overdue, it will go yellow; when within 5 days, Pink. Tasks will always go red when actually overdue. Defaults to 60 days and 30 days respectively. Program Code: Examples are PF, PT, et3. You can use unit program codes, similar to ARMS program codes, to filter unit tasks. You can assign multiple program codes to the same task. If the task is to be mapped to an ADLS task, it must have a program code of ADLS. Active: Used to turn on the task. Inactive tasks wil be hidden throughout the rest of PEX. No-Go: No-Go is locally-determined. Marking a task as No-Go will turn a person's Training No-Go indicator red when the task is overdue. No-Go tasks are usually reserved for tasks that prevent a person from accomplishing duty, even with supervision, tasks such as Flight Physical or Altitude Chamber. No-Go tasks should not be dual categorized as Priority 1. Auditing Required: When selected, the task will not update the person's training records until approved by the auditor. If not selected, as soon as the person reports accomplishment of the task, the task is considered done, without any supervisory auditing, and the person's training records are updated.

The ARMS Bypass feature allows PEX users to ignore or bypass ARMS Training Task dates, on the occasion ARMS is down. With the bypass on, PEX will temporarily calculate training due dates within PEX. Setting the Bypass to \"On\" will allow the unit to bypass ARMS currency and/or currency/proficiency type training events. It has no effect on proficiency and one-time tasks. Bypass means the unit will use PEX to manually calculate due dates for specific training events based off of a person's last recorded accomplished date. Setting the Bypass to \"Off\" with no ARMS training file import, means accomplished and due dates in PEX will not be updated until the next ARMS file import, even when logged and audited. Roles: Training/Auditor ARMS and Squadron Administrator can turn this feature on or off. All other roles will be able to see banners throughout PEX in those areas where ARMS Training Events are displayed. !!! CAUTION The Bypass feature is a back-up for the selected squadron when ARMS is down. It all ows users to overwrite Currency training event dates until ARMS is back online. Users must have source documents for overwriting dates. Bypass is turned off when an ARMS import is done and/or a user turns it off. ARMS is the true source for all training information; PEX is not a replacement system. Set the ARMS Bypass to On. Go to Training > Continuation > Setup > ARMS Tasks > Squadron.

This upgrade training can take the form of short in-unit upgrades and formal schoolhouse upgrades. Before you can utilize Mission training, you must configure several Setup features to your unit\u2019s specifications. This includes adding Grade Sets, creating Training Tasks that wil be used for your courses, and setting the number of monthly and quarterly reviews for student\u2019s Grade Folders. Controls Access this module by navigating to Main Menu > Training > Mission. Workspace Setup Mission Training Select the Setup Tab in the QT module. Add a Grade Set A grade set is all the different grades you will use when evaluating student tasks and Blocks of Instruction (BOI). Each MAJCOM uses different grades. A Grade Set is where you tell PEX which grades you are going to use. Training > Mission > Setup > Course Grade Sets. Select the squadron from the dropdown menu. Right-Click in the Course Grade Sets Canvas and select Add. Create a Grade Set Name and click on the Canvas to save. Decide whether your MAJCOM/Unit utilizes: 1) Task Grades and BOI Grades or 2) Task Proficiency Levels, Task Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades. !!! NOTE All Grade Sets require BOI grades. You wil need to know this information in order to decide which Gradesheet form you should select when you are ready to create your course. Selecting the correct Gradesheet form that corresponds to your Grade Set will allow your grades to automatically populate to your chosen form once grading is complete. See Help Topic, QT - Create Courses for selecting the appropriate Gradesheet forms. Add grades to the appropriate panel by right-clicking in the specific grid you would like to use. Assign grades/levels with the appropriate ranking (1 is the highest). It is imperative you assign the appropriate ranking to all grades/levels in order for the grading feature to work properly in PEX. Task Grade. These are the grades students can achieve on a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. Task Proficiency Level. Displays the grades student can achieve when they demonstrate/perform a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. Task Knowledge Level. Displays the grades student can achieve when they describe/explain a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. BOI Grade. The grades students can achieve after completing a Block of Instruction. This field is required for all courses. Select the checkbox for the default grade/level for each panel, if desired. The default grade/level will automatically populate minimum grades for all BOIs and tasks built in the course. PEX will classify any grades above the minimum as satisfying requirements and any grade below the minimum as failing. If you would like to change the default minimum grade for specific BOIs or tasks, you can make this adjustment in the Course Build on the desired BOI(s) and task(s). See Help Topic, QT - Building Courses. Other options from this screen include the ability to send a Grade Set to another squadron (Send To), delete, print, and export Grades, Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels and/or BOI Grades to Excel by right-clicking a specific Grade Set. !!! NOTE Once a Grade Set is assigned to a course, you cannot make any revisions to that specific Grade Set. If you need to make revisions to a Grade Set that is being used, create a new Grade Set with a different name. Apply the new Grade Set to your desired course while you are on the Courses page. Delete the older/inaccurate Grade Set. Applying a new Grade Set for a course that has already been built will delete all minimum required Task Grades, Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades.
